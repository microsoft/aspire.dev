## 🆙 Upgrade to Aspire 13.2

<Aside type="caution">
Aspire 13.2 includes breaking changes to event handling and connection properties. Please review the [Breaking changes](#️-breaking-changes) section before upgrading.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
If you are on a version of the Aspire CLI less than 13, please use the [installation instructions](/get-started/install-cli/) to install the latest stable version.
</Aside>

The easiest way to upgrade to Aspire 13.2 is using the `aspire update` command:

1. Update your Aspire project using the [`aspire update` command](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-update/):

    ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Update all Aspire packages"
    aspire update
    ```

2. Update the Aspire CLI itself:

    ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Update the CLI"
    aspire update --self
    ```

## 🚀 Detached mode and process management

Aspire 13.2 introduces the ability to run your applications in the background, freeing up your terminal for other work.

### Run in detached mode

Use the new `--detach` flag to run your Aspire application in the background:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Run in detached mode"
aspire run --detach
```

When running in detached mode, the dashboard URL is displayed and the CLI returns immediately, allowing you to continue using your terminal.

### Stop running applications

The new `aspire stop` command terminates running AppHost instances:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Stop running applications"
aspire stop
```

The stop command uses socket-first discovery for optimal performance and can target specific AppHosts when multiple are running.

<LearnMore>
Command reference: [`aspire run`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-run/) and [`aspire stop`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-stop/).
</LearnMore>

### List running AppHosts

The new `aspire ps` command displays all running Aspire AppHost instances:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — List running AppHosts"
aspire ps
```

This command provides visibility into which applications are currently active on your machine, including their process IDs and dashboard URLs.

## 🩺 Environment validation with aspire doctor

The new `aspire doctor` command validates your development environment and identifies potential issues:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Validate environment"
aspire doctor
```

The command performs comprehensive checks including:

- **Docker/Podman version verification**: Ensures your container runtime meets minimum requirements.
- **Development certificate validation**: Detects and warns about multiple HTTPS development certificates.
- **Deprecated workload detection**: Checks for the deprecated 'aspire' workload and recommends migration.
- **Container runtime availability**: Validates that Docker or Podman is properly configured.

```plaintext title="Example output" data-disable-copy
✓ .NET SDK: 10.0.102
✓ Docker: 27.5.0
✓ Container runtime: Available
⚠ Multiple HTTPS development certificates detected
  Run 'dotnet dev-certs https --clean' to remove duplicates
```

The `aspire doctor` command is also exposed as an MCP tool, enabling AI coding agents to diagnose environment issues.

## 📟 CLI telemetry and logging commands

### Access resource logs

The new `aspire logs` command retrieves logs from running resources:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — View resource logs"
aspire logs <resource-name>
```

This command provides a convenient way to access container and project logs without navigating to the dashboard.

### View resources

The new `aspire resources` command lists all resources in a running AppHost:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — List resources"
aspire resources
```

### CLI telemetry

Aspire CLI now exports telemetry data for commands, helping the team understand usage patterns and improve the developer experience. Telemetry is opt-out and respects standard .NET telemetry environment variables.

## 🔷 TypeScript AppHost support

Aspire 13.2 extends polyglot support with the ability to write your AppHost in TypeScript. This enables JavaScript and TypeScript developers to define their distributed applications using familiar syntax and tooling.

```typescript title="TypeScript — AppHost example"
import { AppHost } from '@aspire/apphost';

const builder = new AppHost();

const redis = builder.addRedis('cache');
const api = builder.addProject('api', '../Api/Api.csproj')
    .withReference(redis);

builder.addNpmApp('frontend', '../frontend')
    .withReference(api)
    .withExternalHttpEndpoints();

await builder.run();
```

The TypeScript SDK provides:

- Full type definitions for all Aspire resources and APIs.
- Integration with popular Node.js package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).
- Seamless interoperability with .NET projects and containers.
- Support for all Aspire annotations and configuration options.

## ⚠️ Breaking changes

<span id='-breaking-changes'></span>

### BeforeResourceStartedEvent behavior change

The `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` now only fires when a resource is actually starting for the first time. Previously, it could fire during restarts or other state transitions. Update any event handlers that relied on the previous behavior.

### Connection property suffix changes

Some connection properties have been updated for consistency. If your polyglot applications rely on specific environment variable names, please verify they still work correctly.

### IAzureContainerRegistry obsolete

The `IAzureContainerRegistry` interface is now obsolete. Use the `ContainerRegistry` property on compute environments instead:

```csharp title="C# — Container registry access (before)" data-disable-copy
// Before (Aspire 13.1)
var registry = environment as IAzureContainerRegistry;
```

```csharp title="C# — Container registry access (after)"
// After (Aspire 13.2)
var registry = environment.ContainerRegistry;
```

### Migration from Aspire 13.1 to 13.2

<Steps>

1. **Update the CLI**: Run `aspire update --self`.
2. **Update your projects**: Run `aspire update` in your project directory.
3. **Run aspire doctor**: Validate your environment with `aspire doctor`.
4. **Review event handlers**: Check any `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` handlers for compatibility.
5. **Update Azure container registry access**: Replace `IAzureContainerRegistry` casts with `ContainerRegistry` property access.

</Steps>
