Aspire 13.2 brings significant improvements to the developer experience with enhanced CLI capabilities, dashboard improvements, new AI agent integrations, and better polyglot support. This release focuses on making local development more streamlined while maintaining the robust cloud-native foundation that Aspire is known for.

## Aspire CLI enhancements

### Detached mode and process management

One of the most requested features lands in 13.2: **detached mode** for running Aspire applications. You can now run your AppHost in the background, freeing up your terminal for other tasks.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Detached mode and process management"
# Run in detached mode
aspire run --detach

# List all running AppHosts
aspire ps

# Stop a running AppHost
aspire stop
```

The `aspire ps` command displays all currently running Aspire AppHosts, making it easy to manage multiple projects simultaneously. When combined with `aspire stop`, you have full control over your application lifecycle directly from the command line.

Command reference: [`aspire run`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-run/), [`aspire ps`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-ps/), and [`aspire stop`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-stop/).
</LearnMore>

### Isolated mode for parallel development

The new `--isolated` flag enables running multiple instances of the same AppHost simultaneously:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Isolated mode"
aspire run --isolated
```

This mode uses randomized ports and isolated user secrets, which is particularly useful when you need to test different configurations side-by-side or run integration tests in parallel.

### Environment diagnostics with `aspire doctor`

The new `aspire doctor` command provides comprehensive diagnostics of your development environment:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Environment diagnostics"
aspire doctor
```

This command checks:
- .NET SDK installation and version
- HTTPS development certificate status (including detection of multiple certificates)
- Container runtime (Docker/Podman) availability and version
- WSL2 environment configuration
- Container tunnel requirements for Docker Engine

The output provides actionable recommendations when issues are detected, making it easier to troubleshoot configuration problems.

### Enhanced `aspire add` with fuzzy search

Finding the right integration package is now easier with fuzzy search in the `aspire add` command. Simply start typing and the CLI will suggest matching packages, reducing the friction of discovering and adding new integrations to your project.

<LearnMore>
Command reference: [`aspire add`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-add/).
</LearnMore>

### Agent integration (`aspire agent`)

The `aspire mcp` command has been renamed to `aspire agent` to better reflect its purpose of managing AI agent integrations. The new command structure includes:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Agent integration"
# Start the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
aspire agent mcp

# Initialize agent environment configuration
aspire agent init
```

This enables AI agents to interact with your Aspire applications through a standardized protocol, opening up new possibilities for AI-assisted development workflows.

Command reference: [`aspire agent`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-agent/).

### Improved configuration management

The `aspire config` command has been enhanced with better organization:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Configuration management"
# List all configuration with organized sections and colors
aspire config list

# Get a specific setting
aspire config get <key>

# Set a configuration value
aspire config set <key> <value>
```

Configuration is now clearly separated into local and global settings, with feature flags displayed in an organized manner.

Command reference: [`aspire config`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-config/).

### CLI telemetry

Aspire CLI now includes optional telemetry to help improve the developer experience. Telemetry data is version-consistent with the dashboard, providing a unified approach to usage analytics. All telemetry follows standard privacy practices and can be controlled through configuration.

## 🆙 Upgrade to Aspire 13.2

<Aside type="caution">
  Aspire 13.2 includes breaking changes to event handling and connection properties. Please review the [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes) section before upgrading.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
If you are on a version of the Aspire CLI less than 13, please use the [installation instructions](/get-started/install-cli/) to install the latest stable version.
</Aside>

The easiest way to upgrade to Aspire 13.2 is using the `aspire update` command:

1. Update your Aspire project using the [`aspire update` command](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-update/):

    ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Update all Aspire packages"
    aspire update
    ```

2. Update the Aspire CLI itself:

    ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Update the CLI"
    aspire update --self
    ```

Or install the CLI from scratch:

```bash
curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash
```

## Dashboard improvements

*This document covers the key changes in Aspire 13.2. For a complete list of changes, see the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/milestone/25).*

## Breaking changes

### `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` behavior

The `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` now only fires when actually starting a resource, not on every state change. Update your event handlers if they rely on the previous behavior.

### Connection property suffix

A connection property suffix has been added which may require updates to code that accesses connection properties directly.

### `IAzureContainerRegistry` obsolete

The `IAzureContainerRegistry` interface has been marked as obsolete. Use the new `ContainerRegistry` property on compute environments instead.
