Upgrading Aspire is simple using the **Aspire CLI**. Run `aspire update` and you're done.

<Aside type="tip">
If you're new to Aspire, there's no reason to upgrade anything. See [Setup and tooling](/get-started/setup-and-tooling/) to get started.
</Aside>

## Upgrade with the Aspire CLI

<Steps>

1. **Update the Aspire CLI** to the latest version:

    ```bash
    aspire update --self
    ```

    <Aside type="note" title="Don't have the Aspire CLI installed?">
    If you haven't installed the Aspire CLI yet, see [Install the Aspire CLI](/reference/cli/) for installation instructions.
    </Aside>

2. **Update your Aspire project** by running:

    ```bash
    aspire update
    ```

    This command automatically:

    - Updates the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version
    - Updates all Aspire NuGet packages to the latest version
    - Handles dependency resolution
    - Supports both regular projects and Central Package Management (CPM)

</Steps>

## Upgrade with the Upgrade Assistant CLI

The [Upgrade Assistant](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) is another option for upgrading Aspire projects.

<Steps>

1. **Install the Upgrade Assistant** (if not already installed):

    ```bash
    dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant
    ```

2. **Run the upgrade** from your AppHost project directory:

    ```bash
    upgrade-assistant upgrade
    ```

3. **Select the Aspire upgrades** option when prompted and follow the interactive prompts.

</Steps>

## Update the VS Code extension (optional)

If you have the Aspire extension installed, you can update it to get the latest tooling support:

<Steps>

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to **Extensions** (<Kbd windows="Ctrl+Shift+X" mac="Cmd+Shift+X" />)
3. Search for **.NET Aspire**
4. Click **Update** if an update is available

</Steps>

## Breaking changes

Review breaking changes for all versions between your current version and the target version. See the release notes in the [What's new](/whats-new/aspire-13-1/) section.

## Remove the legacy workload (Aspire 8 only)

<Aside type="note">
This step is only needed if you're upgrading from Aspire 8. Skip this if you're already on Aspire 9 or later.
</Aside>

The legacy **aspire workload** is no longer required and should be removed:

```bash 
dotnet workload uninstall aspire
```

## Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, run your application to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash title="Run the Aspire application"
aspire run
```
