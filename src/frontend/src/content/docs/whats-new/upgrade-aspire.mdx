Upgrading Aspire is simple using the **Aspire CLI**. Run `aspire update` and you're done.

<Aside type="tip">
If you're new to Aspire, there's no reason to upgrade anything. See [prerequisites](/get-started/prerequisites/) and [install Aspire CLI](/get-started/install-cli/) to get started.
</Aside>

## Upgrade with the Aspire CLI

<Steps>

1. **Update the Aspire CLI** to the latest version:

    ```bash title="Update the Aspire CLI"
    aspire update --self
    ```

    <Aside type="note" title="Don't have the Aspire CLI installed?">
    If you haven't installed the Aspire CLI yet, see [Install the Aspire CLI](/get-started/install-cli/) for installation instructions.
    </Aside>

2. **Update your Aspire solution** by running:

    ```bash title="Update your Aspire solution"
    aspire update
    ```

    This command automatically:

    - Updates the [`Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version](/get-started/aspire-sdk/)
    - Updates all Aspire NuGet packages to the latest version
    - Handles dependency resolution
    - Supports both regular projects and Central Package Management (CPM)

</Steps>

## Upgrade with the Upgrade Assistant CLI

The [Upgrade Assistant](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) is another option for upgrading Aspire projects.

<Steps>

1. **Install the Upgrade Assistant** (if not already installed):

    ```bash title="Install the Upgrade Assistant"
    dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant
    ```

2. **Run the upgrade** from your AppHost project directory:

    ```bash title="Run the Upgrade Assistant"
    upgrade-assistant upgrade
    ```

3. **Select the Aspire upgrades** option when prompted and follow the interactive prompts.

</Steps>

## Update the VS Code extension (optional)

If you have the Aspire extension installed, you can update it to get the latest tooling support:

<Steps>

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to **Extensions** (<Kbd windows="Ctrl+Shift+X" mac="Cmd+Shift+X" />)
3. Search for **Aspire**
4. Click **Update** if an update is available

</Steps>

## Breaking changes

Review breaking changes for all versions between your current version and the target version. See the release notes in the [What's new](/whats-new/aspire-13-1/) section.

## Remove the legacy workload (Aspire 8 only)

Still rocking the Aspire workload? No judgment here—we've all been there. 🕰️ Time to let it go and join us in the future!

<Aside type="note">
This step is only needed if you're upgrading from Aspire 8. If you're already on Aspire 9 or later, you're good—treat yourself to a coffee instead. ☕
</Aside>

Please remove the **aspire workload** with the following command:

```bash 
dotnet workload uninstall aspire
```

## Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, run your application to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash title="Run the Aspire application"
aspire run
```
