The Aspire SDK is intended for [AppHost projects](/get-started/app-host/), which serve as the orchestrator for Aspire applications. These projects are designated by their usage of the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` in the project file. The SDK provides features that simplify the development of Aspire apps.

The [📦 Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) is used for building Aspire apps.

<Tabs syncKey='sdk'>

<TabItem label='Project file'>

The `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` is defined in the top-level `Project` node's `Sdk` attribute:

```xml title='XML — *.csproj file' {1}
<Project Sdk="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk/13.1">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    </PropertyGroup>

    <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
</Project>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="File-based app">

The `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` is defined in a file-based app's source file using the `#:sdk` directive:

```csharp title='C# — file-based app' {1}
#:sdk Aspire.AppHost.Sdk@13.1.0

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Omitted for brevity
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The preceding example defines the top-level SDK as `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`. The project also references the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.AppHost](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.AppHost) package which brings in a number of Aspire-related dependencies.

## SDK Features

The Aspire SDK provides several key features.

### Project references

Each `ProjectReference` in the AppHost project isn't treated as standard project references. Instead, they enable the AppHost to execute these projects as part of its orchestration. Each project reference triggers a generator to create a `class` that represents the project as an `IProjectMetadata`. This metadata is used to populate the named projects in the generated `Projects` namespace. When you call the `AddProject` API, the `Projects` namespace is used to reference the project—passing the generated class as a generic-type parameter.

:::tip
To prevent a project from being treated as an Aspire resource in the AppHost, set the `IsAspireProjectResource` attribute on the `ProjectReference` element to `false`, as shown in the following example:

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\MyProject\MyProject.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
```

Otherwise, by default, the `ProjectReference` is treated as Aspire project resource.

### Orchestrator dependencies

The Aspire SDK dynamically adds references to the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview/) and other AppHost dependencies, such as the developer control plane (DCP) packages. These dependencies are specific to the platform that the AppHost is built on.

When the AppHost project runs, the orchestrator relies on these dependencies to provide the necessary functionality to the AppHost. For more information, see [Aspire orchestration overview](/get-started/app-host/).
