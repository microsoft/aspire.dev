This glossary defines the key terms and concepts you'll encounter when working with Aspire. Bookmark this page as a quick reference.

## Core concepts

These are the foundational concepts you need to understand when working with Aspire.

### AppHost

The **AppHost** is the orchestration project where you define your entire application's architecture in C# code. It's a special Aspire project that:

- Declares what services, databases, and containers make up your application
- Defines how resources depend on each other
- Configures how resources communicate
- Orchestrates startup order during local development
- Generates deployment manifests for production

Think of it as the "control tower" for your distributed application.

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
// This IS the AppHost - Program.cs in your AppHost project
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var db = builder.AddPostgres("db");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(db);

builder.Build().Run();
```

### Resource

A **resource** is any component that your application depends on. Resources can be:

| Resource type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Projects** | .NET applications, services, APIs |
| **Containers** | Docker containers (databases, caches, message brokers) |
| **Executables** | Node.js apps, Python scripts, any executable |
| **Cloud services** | Azure Storage, AWS S3, managed databases |
| **Parameters** | Configuration values, secrets |

Resources are the building blocks you compose in your AppHost.

### Distributed application

A **distributed application**is an application split into multiple independent services that communicate over a network. Instead of one monolithic application, you have:

- A frontend service
- One or more API services  
- Databases
- Caches
- Message queues
- etc.

Aspire helps you orchestrate all these pieces together.

### Service defaults

**Service defaults**are pre-configured settings that Aspire applies to your .NET projects automatically. They include:

- **OpenTelemetry** - Automatic logging, tracing, and metrics
- **Health checks** - Endpoints for monitoring (`/health`, `/alive`)
- **Service discovery** - Automatic resolution of service URLs
- **Resilience** - Retry policies for HTTP calls

When you add `builder.AddServiceDefaults()` to a project, you get production-ready observability and resilience out of the box.

## APIs and patterns

These are the key APIs and patterns you'll use when building Aspire applications.

### WithReference

`WithReference()` is how you connect resources together. When you call `.WithReference(otherResource)`, Aspire:

1. Injects the connection information as environment variables
2. Sets up service discovery so your code can find the other resource
3. Creates a dependency relationship for startup ordering

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var db = builder.AddPostgres("db");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(db);  // API now has DATABASE connection info injected
```

The API project will receive environment variables like:
- `ConnectionStrings__db` - The database connection string
- Service discovery configuration for the "db" resource

### WaitFor

`WaitFor()` tells Aspire to delay starting a resource until its dependency is ready:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var db = builder.AddPostgres("db");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(db)
    .WaitFor(db);  // Don't start API until database is healthy
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Without `WaitFor()`, your API might start and immediately crash because the database isn't ready yet. This prevents race conditions during startup.
</Aside>

### WaitForCompletion

`WaitForCompletion()` waits for a resource to finish and exit (not just start). Useful for setup scripts:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var migrate = builder.AddProject<Projects.DbMigration>("migrate");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WaitForCompletion(migrate);  // Wait for migrations to complete
```

### WaitForStart

`WaitForStart()` waits only for a resource to reach the running state, without waiting for health checks to pass:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var db = builder.AddPostgres("db");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WaitForStart(db);  // Start as soon as db is running, don't wait for healthy
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Use `WaitForStart()` when you need looser coupling—your service can handle initial connection failures via retry policies. Use `WaitFor()` when you need strict dependency on health.
</Aside>

## Key terms

These terms appear frequently throughout the documentation and in error messages.

### Connection string

A **connection string** is a formatted string containing the information needed to connect to a resource (database, cache, message broker, etc.). In Aspire, connection strings are:

- Automatically generated by the AppHost based on resource configuration
- Injected into your application as environment variables
- Retrieved using `builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("resource-name")`

Example: `Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=mydb;Username=postgres;Password=secret`

### Service discovery

**Service discovery**is the mechanism that allows your services to find and communicate with each other by name, without hardcoding addresses. In Aspire:

- Resources are addressable by their resource name (e.g., `http://apiservice`)
- The AppHost configures DNS/environment variables so services can resolve each other
- Works automatically when you use `WithReference()`

For details, see [Service Discovery](/fundamentals/service-discovery/).

### Health check

A **health check**is a mechanism to determine if a resource is ready and functioning. Aspire uses health checks in two ways:

1. **AppHost level**: Determines when dependencies are ready (controls `WaitFor()` behavior)
2. **Application level**: Exposes `/health` and `/alive` endpoints for load balancers

For details, see [Health Checks](/fundamentals/health-checks/).

### Environment variable

Aspire uses **environment variables**to pass configuration from the AppHost to your services:

- Connection strings: `ConnectionStrings__resourcename`
- Service endpoints: `services__servicename__https__0`
- Custom values via `WithEnvironment()`

Your application reads these using standard .NET configuration (`IConfiguration`).

---

## Resource types

Aspire uses two types of NuGet packages to work with resources.

### Hosting integration

A **hosting integration** is an Aspire package that helps you add and configure resources in your AppHost. Hosting integrations:

- Add containers or cloud resources to your app model
- Configure networking, health checks, and volumes
- Handle connection string generation

Example: `Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL` adds the `AddPostgres()` method.

### Client integration

A **client integration**is an Aspire package that helps your application code connect to resources. Client integrations:

- Register SDK clients with dependency injection
- Configure connection strings from environment variables
- Add health checks and telemetry

Example: `Aspire.Npgsql` registers `NpgsqlConnection` for PostgreSQL.

### The relationship

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AppHost (uses Hosting Integration)                          │
│   Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL → AddPostgres("db")             │
│                                   ↓                         │
│                          Injects connection info            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ API Project (uses Client Integration)                       │
│   Aspire.Npgsql → builder.AddNpgsqlDataSource("db")         │
│                          ↓                                  │
│                  Reads connection from env vars             │
│                  Registers NpgsqlConnection in DI           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Execution modes

Aspire operates in two distinct modes depending on what you're trying to accomplish.

### Run mode

**Run mode** is local development. When you execute `aspire run` or debug your AppHost:

- Aspire starts all your resources locally
- Containers run in Docker
- The Aspire Dashboard shows logs and traces
- Service discovery uses localhost addresses

### Publish mode

**Publish mode**generates deployment artifacts. When you execute `aspire publish`:

- Aspire generates Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, or cloud infrastructure
- No containers are started locally
- Connection strings reference production endpoints
- Output is ready for CI/CD pipelines

---

## Dashboard and observability

Aspire provides built-in tools for monitoring and debugging your applications.

### Aspire dashboard

The **Aspire Dashboard** is a web UI that automatically runs during local development. It shows:

- All your resources and their status
- Real-time logs from every service
- Distributed traces across service calls
- Metrics and performance data
- Resource health checks

Access it at the URL shown when you run `aspire run` (typically `http://localhost:15888`).

### OpenTelemetry

**OpenTelemetry** (OTEL) is the observability standard that Aspire uses for:

- **Logs** - Structured logging with context
- **Traces** - Following requests across services
- **Metrics** - Performance measurements

Aspire configures OpenTelemetry automatically through service defaults.

---

## Common patterns

These patterns appear frequently in Aspire applications.

### Emulator pattern

Many hosting integrations support running as an **emulator** for local development:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .RunAsEmulator();  // Uses Azurite container locally
```

This lets you develop against Azure, AWS, or other cloud services without needing actual cloud accounts during development.

### Existing resource pattern

Connect to resources that already exist (not managed by Aspire):

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var existingDb = builder.AddPostgres("db")
    .AsExisting(name, resourceGroup);
```

Use this for production databases or shared team resources.

## API reference terms

These terms appear frequently in API documentation and advanced usage:

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `IResourceAnnotation` | Typed metadata object attached to resources. |
| `WithAnnotation()` | Fluent method to attach typed annotations. |
| `ReferenceExpression` | Structured formatter preserving value references. |
| `ResourceNotificationService` | Publishes observable state updates. |

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| DAG | Directed acyclic graph—the structure of resource dependencies. |
| Heterogeneous DAG | DAG containing varied resource types (projects, containers, cloud). |
| Publisher | Component that emits deployment artifacts from the app model. |
| Hoisting | Leaving a value unresolved for later substitution at runtime. |
| Deferred evaluation | Computing a value only when needed. |
| Lifecycle events | Time-based signals for resource transitions. |
