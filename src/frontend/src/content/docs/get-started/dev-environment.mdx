Follow the [Install CLI guide](/get-started/install-cli/) to install the Aspire CLI for your platform.

### Key Commands

Once installed, you can use these commands to work with Aspire:

#### Create a new application

```bash
aspire new starter --name MyApp
```

Creates a new Aspire starter application with an AppHost, a web frontend, and an API service.

#### Run your application

```bash
aspire run
```

Starts your Aspire application and opens the dashboard in your browser.

#### Add integrations

```bash
aspire add
```

Interactively adds Aspire integrations (databases, caches, message queues, etc.) to your project.

#### Deploy your application

```bash
aspire deploy
```

Deploys your Aspire application to a cloud provider (Azure Container Apps, Kubernetes, etc.).

### Using the CLI with editors

The Aspire CLI works well with any text editor:

- **Vim/Neovim** - Use with LSP for .NET support
- **Emacs** - Configure with omnisharp for C# editing
