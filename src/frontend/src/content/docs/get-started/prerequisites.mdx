Ready to dive into Aspire? Before you begin, make sure your development environment is set up with a few essential tools. This guide walks you through everything you need to start building and running Aspire solutions with confidence.

<Steps>
1. **Install an OCI-compliant container runtime**

   Aspire can run containers using several OCI-compatible runtimes, including Docker Desktop and Podman.

    - <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" target="_blank">Docker Desktop</a> is the most popular container runtime among Aspire developers, offering a familiar and widely supported environment for building and running containers.

    - <a href="https://podman.io/" target="_blank">Podman</a> is an open-source, daemonless alternative to Docker. It supports building and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers, making it a flexible choice for developers who prefer a lightweight solution.

      <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
          <Code title='Set the ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME environment variable to podman'
                code={`export ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman`} lang="bash" />
        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
          <Code title='Set the ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME environment variable to podman'
                code={`[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME", "podman", "User")`} lang="powershell" />  
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

    - <a href="https://rancherdesktop.io/" target="_blank">Rancher Desktop</a> has been reported by users as a successful alternative—particularly when configured to use the Docker CLI. However, Rancher Desktop is not an officially supported or regularly tested scenario for Aspire. If you encounter issues with Rancher Desktop, please let us know, but fixes may not be prioritized.

1. **Install an integrated development environment (IDE)**

    Aspire supports multiple IDEs and code editors. You can choose the one that best fits your workflow:

    :::note[Visual Studio Code]{icon="vscode"}
    We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the best experience—a lightweight, cross-platform code editor with excellent Aspire support.

    Install the following extensions to get started:
    - [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) for C# language support.
    - [Aspire extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-aspire.aspire-vscode) for Aspire-specific commands and features.
    :::

    Aspire also works well with:

    - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/): A full-featured IDE for C# development with debugging, IntelliSense, and Git support.
    - [JetBrains Rider](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23289--net-aspire): A powerful, cross-platform C# IDE with advanced features like code analysis, refactoring, and debugging.
    <br/>

</Steps>

**Consider alternatives to local installation**

If you prefer not to install the prerequisites on your local machine, you can develop Aspire solutions using cloud-based options like [GitHub Codespaces](../get-started/github-codespaces.md) or [Dev Containers](../get-started/dev-containers.md). These options allow you to work in a cloud-based environment, eliminating the need for local installations, but may not provide the same performance as local installations.
