In this tutorial, you take the app you created in the [Build your first Aspire app](/get-started/first-app) quickstart and deploy it. This can be broken down into several key steps:

<Steps>
1. [Add deployment package](#add-deployment-package) — Add the hosting package for your target.
1. [Update your AppHost](#update-your-apphost) — Configure the environment API.
1. [Deploy your app](#deploy-your-app) — Deploy using the Aspire CLI.
1. [Verify your deployment](#verify-your-deployment) — Ensure your app is running as expected.
1. [Clean up resources](#clean-up-resources) — Remove any deployed resources to avoid incurring costs.
</Steps>

The following diagram shows the architecture of the sample app you're deploying:

service frontend(logos:react)[React front end] in f-docker

http:L --> R:api
```
</Pivot>

service frontend(logos:react)[React front end] in docker

api:L --> R:svr
http:L --> R:api
frontend:L --> R:http
```
</Pivot>

## Add deployment package

In the root directory of your Aspire solution that you created in the previous quickstart, add the appropriate hosting deployment package by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="deploy-target">
    <TabItem id="azure" label="Azure">

        ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Add Azure App Containers"
        aspire add azure-appcontainers
        ```

        The Aspire CLI is interactive, be sure to select the appropriate search result for the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers) version you want to add.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem id="docker-compose" label="Docker Compose" icon="seti:docker">

        [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, making it easier to manage and deploy complex applications locally or in various environments.

        ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Add Docker Compose"
        aspire add docker
        ```

        The Aspire CLI is interactive, be sure to select the appropriate search result for the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Docker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Docker) version you want to add.

## Deploy your app

Now that you've added the deployment package and updated your AppHost, you can deploy your Aspire app.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Deploy your app"
aspire deploy
```

<Aside type="note" title="Common pitfall..." icon="seti:todo">
If you call `aspire deploy` and you see output similar to the following, be sure that you've actually [updated your AppHost](#update-your-apphost) to include the appropriate environment API for your target. This output indicates that there are no deploy steps configured for your target environment.

### Post deployment output

After a deployment, the Aspire CLI writes to the provided output path (or the default output path if none is provided) a set of files based on your deployment target. This may include files such as Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests, or cloud provider-specific configuration files.

<Tabs syncKey="deploy-target">
    <TabItem id="azure" label="Azure">
        <FileTree>
        - ./output
        </FileTree>

    <Pivot id="csharp">

          - .env
          - .env.Production
          - docker-compose.yaml
        </FileTree>

        The `aspire-output` directory contains the generated environment variables and the Docker Compose configuration. The best part is, these files are opaque to you as a developer—you don't need to write them yourself!

        The `.env.Production` file contains the name of the app image:

        ```dotenv title="./aspire-output/.env.Production"
        # Container image name for apiservice
        APISERVICE_IMAGE=apiservice:latest

        # Default container port for apiservice
        APISERVICE_PORT=8080

        # Container image name for webfrontend
        WEBFRONTEND_IMAGE=webfrontend:latest

        # Default container port for webfrontend
        WEBFRONTEND_PORT=8080
        ```

        Finally, the `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the services for both the API and front end:

        ```yaml title="./aspire-output/docker-compose.yaml"
        services:
        env-dashboard:

        ```dotenv title="./aspire-output/.env.Production"
        APP_IMAGE=app:5d592d0c1d2f417b0c14c4c4a9efb4f0760be8e4
        ```

        The `app.Dockerfile` is generated as a multi-stage Dockerfile to build the Python and also serve the React front end using Uvicorn:

        ```dockerfile title="./aspire-output/app.Dockerfile"
        ARG FRONTEND_IMAGENAME=frontend:50f0ed07a5b8f57b3213e99d96b2e8ff68a1d5d7

        FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim AS builder

        # Enable bytecode compilation and copy mode for the virtual environment
        ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1
        ENV UV_LINK_MODE=copy

        WORKDIR /app

        # Copy pyproject.toml to install dependencies
        COPY pyproject.toml /app/

        # Install dependencies and generate lock file
        # Uses BuildKit cache mount to speed up repeated builds
        RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
            uv sync --no-install-project --no-dev

        # Copy the rest of the application source and install the project
        COPY . /app
        RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
            uv sync --no-dev

        FROM ${FRONTEND_IMAGENAME} AS frontend_stage

        FROM python:3.13-slim-bookworm AS app

        COPY --from=frontend_stage /app/dist /app/./static

        # ------------------------------
        # 🚀 Runtime stage
        # ------------------------------
        # Create non-root user for security
        RUN groupadd --system --gid 999 appuser && useradd --system --gid 999 --uid 999 --create-home appuser

        # Copy the application and virtual environment from builder
        COPY --from=builder --chown=appuser:appuser /app /app

        # Add virtual environment to PATH and set VIRTUAL_ENV
        ENV PATH=/app/.venv/bin:${PATH}
        ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/app/.venv
        ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
        ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

        # Use the non-root user to run the application
        USER appuser

        # Set working directory
        WORKDIR /app

        # Run the application
        ENTRYPOINT ["uvicorn"]
        ```

        Finally, the `docker-compose.yaml` file defines the services for both the API and front end:

        ```yaml title="./aspire-output/docker-compose.yaml"
        services:
        env-dashboard:
            image: "mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly/aspire-dashboard:latest"
            expose:

            command:
            - "main:app"
            - "--host"
            - "0.0.0.0"
            - "--port"
            - "8000"
            environment:
            OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER: "otlp"
            OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER: "otlp"

            OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL: "grpc"
            OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "app"
            ports:
            - "8000"
            networks:
            - "aspire"
        networks:

        When deploying to Docker Compose, you verify that your application is running by navigating to `http://localhost:{PORT}` in your web browser, where `{PORT}` is the port number you configured for your web frontend service in your Aspire application.

        ```bash title="Docker CLI - List running containers"
        docker ps
        ```        

        <Pivot id="csharp">

        After running the above command, look for an image with a name starting with `webfrontend:latest` and a `COMMAND` value similar to `dotnet /app/AspireApp.W...`. This indicates that your ASP.NET Core/Blazor application is running successfully.
        

        ```bash title="Docker CLI - List running containers" "0.0.0.0:55445->80/tcp"
        CONTAINER ID  IMAGE               COMMAND                CREATED         STATUS        PORTS                  NAMES
        d4f1e8c3b6a1  webfrontend:latest  "dotnet /app/Aspire…"  10 seconds ago  Up 8 seconds  0.0.0.0:55445->80/tcp  aspire_app_webfrontend_1

        ```

        Find the port number in the `PORTS` column—it will look similar to `0.0.0.0:55445->80/tcp`. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:55445` (replace `55445` with your actual port number) to see your deployed application.

        After running the above command, look for an image with a name starting with `app:` followed by a SHA hash (for example, `app:1b50e6124ca45c2d2539808a72664d40cfeed109`) and a `COMMAND` value of `uvicorn main:app...`. This indicates that your Python/React application is running successfully.
        
        ```bash title="Docker CLI - List running containers" "0.0.0.0:53588->80/tcp"

        ```

        Find the port number in the `PORTS` column—it will look similar to `0.0.0.0:53588->80/tcp`. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:53588` (replace `53588` with your actual port number) to see your deployed application.

        />

        The front end displays the weather forecast data in a stunning React template. In this example, both the API service and the React front end are running within the same Docker container.

## Clean up resources

If you have deployed your application to a cloud provider such as Azure, it's important to clean up any resources you created during the deployment process to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. Likewise, if you have deployed your application locally using Docker Compose, you should stop and remove the running containers.
