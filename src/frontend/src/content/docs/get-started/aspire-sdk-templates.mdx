Aspire provides a number of project templates to help you create new apps. You can use these templates to create full Aspire solutions, or add individual projects to existing Aspire solutions.

The Aspire templates are available in the [📦 Aspire.ProjectTemplates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.ProjectTemplates) NuGet package.

## Available templates

The Aspire templates allow you to create new apps pre-configured with the Aspire solutions structure and default settings. These projects also provide a unified debugging experience across the different resources of your app.

Aspire templates are available in two categories: solution templates and project templates. Solution templates create a new Aspire solution with multiple projects, while project templates create individual projects that can be added to an existing Aspire solution.

### Solution templates

The following Aspire solution templates are available (assume the solution is named _AspireSample_):

- **Aspire Empty App**: A minimal Aspire project that includes the following:
  - **AspireSample.AppHost**: An orchestrator project designed to connect and configure the different projects and services of your app.
  - **AspireSample.ServiceDefaults**: An Aspire shared project to manage configurations that are reused across the projects in your solution related to [resilience](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience), [service discovery](/fundamentals/service-discovery/), and [telemetry](/fundamentals/telemetry/).

- **Aspire Starter App**: In addition to the AppHost and ServiceDefaults projects, the Aspire Starter App also includes the following:
  - **AspireSample.ApiService**: An [ASP.NET Core Minimal API](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis) project is used to provide data to the frontend. This project depends on the shared ServiceDefaults project.
  - **AspireSample.Web**: An [ASP.NET Core Blazor App](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor) project with default Aspire service configurations, this project depends on the ServiceDefaults project.
  - **AspireSample.Test**: Either an MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit test project with project references to the AppHost and an example _WebTests.cs_ file demonstrating an integration test.

- **Aspire Starter App with ASP.NET Core and React**: This template includes the AppHost and ServiceDefaults projects, plus:
  - **AspireSample.ApiService**: An [ASP.NET Core Minimal API](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis) project that provides data to the frontend.
  - **AspireSample.Web**: A React-based frontend application with TypeScript configured to work with the Aspire app.

- **Aspire Starter App with FastAPI and React**: This template provides a Python-based starter app with the following projects:
  - **AspireSample.AppHost**: The orchestrator project for managing the app's services.
  - **AspireSample.ApiService**: A [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python backend service that provides data to the frontend.
  - **AspireSample.Web**: A React-based frontend application with TypeScript.

  For more information on getting started with Python in Aspire, see [Build your first app](/get-started/first-app/?lang=python).

### Project templates

The following Aspire project templates are available:

- **Aspire AppHost**: A standalone AppHost project that can be used to orchestrate and manage the different projects and services of your app.

- **Aspire Test projects**: These project templates are used to create test projects for your Aspire app, and they're intended to represent functional and integration tests. The test projects include the following templates:
  - **MSTest**: A project that contains MSTest integration of an Aspire AppHost project.
  - **NUnit**: A project that contains NUnit integration of an Aspire AppHost project.
  - **xUnit**: A project that contains xUnit.net integration of an Aspire AppHost project.

  For more information on the test templates, see [Testing overview](/testing/overview/).

- **Aspire Service Defaults**: A standalone ServiceDefaults project that can be used to manage configurations that are reused across the projects in your solution related to [resilience](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/resilience/http-resilience), [service discovery](/fundamentals/service-discovery/), and [telemetry](/fundamentals/telemetry/).

:::caution
The service defaults project template takes a `FrameworkReference` dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`. This may not be ideal for some project types. For more information, see [Aspire service defaults](/fundamentals/service-defaults/).

## Install the Aspire templates

The Aspire templates are included with the Aspire workload. To install the templates, run the following command:

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates
```

:::tip
To install a specific version of the Aspire templates, use the `::{version}` syntax. For example, to install version 13.1.0, run the following command:

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet new install Aspire.ProjectTemplates::13.1.0
```
:::

## Create solutions and projects using templates

To create an Aspire solution or project, use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the Aspire CLI, and base it on the available templates. Explore additional Aspire templates in the [Aspire samples](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples) repository.

<PivotSelector
  title="Select your development environment"
  key="dev-environment"
  options={[
    { id: 'aspire-cli', title: 'Aspire CLI' },
    { id: 'vscode', title: 'Visual Studio Code' },
    { id: 'visual-studio', title: 'Visual Studio' },
  ]}
/>

<Pivot id="visual-studio">
To create an Aspire project using Visual Studio, search for *Aspire* in the Visual Studio new project window and select your desired template.

<Image
  src={vsCreateProj}
  alt="Visual Studio: Aspire templates showing various Aspire project templates available for selection."
/>

Follow the prompts to configure your project or solution from the template, and then select **Create**.

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="vscode">
To create an Aspire project using Visual Studio Code, search for *Aspire* in the Visual Studio Code new project window and select your desired template.

<ThemeImage
  dark={createProject}
  light={createProjectLight}
  alt="Visual Studio Code: Aspire templates showing various Aspire project templates available for selection."
/>

Select the desired location, enter a name, and select **Create**.

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="aspire-cli">
To create an Aspire solution or project using the Aspire CLI, use the `aspire new` command and specify which template you would like to create.

<LearnMore>
  For detailed information about the `aspire new` command and all available options, see the [aspire new command reference](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-new/).
</LearnMore>

Consider the following examples:

To create an empty AppHost project:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire new aspire-apphost-singlefile
```

To create an Aspire starter app (ASP.NET Core/Blazor), which is a full solution with a sample UI and backing API:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire new aspire-starter
```

To create an Aspire starter app with ASP.NET Core and React:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire new aspire-ts-cs-starter
```

To create an Aspire starter app with FastAPI and React:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire new aspire-py-starter
```

:::tip
The `aspire new` command runs in interactive mode by default. When you don't provide options like `--name` or `--output`, the command prompts you for these values. To run non-interactively, provide all required options:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire new aspire-starter --name MyApp --output ./projects
```
:::

You need to trust the ASP.NET Core localhost certificate before running the app. Run the following command:

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

For more information, see [Troubleshoot untrusted localhost certificate](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/troubleshooting/untrusted-localhost-certificate). For in-depth details about troubleshooting localhost certificates on Linux, see [ASP.NET Core: GitHub repository issue #32842](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32842).
