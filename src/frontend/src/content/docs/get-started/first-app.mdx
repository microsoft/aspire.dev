In this quickstart, you'll create and run your first Aspire application using the Aspire CLI. This guide walks you through generating a new Aspire solution from a template, running the application locally with Aspire's dev-time orchestration, and exploring the Aspire dashboard.

## Create a new app

To create your first Aspire application, use the [Aspire CLI](/get-started/install-cli/) to generate a new solution from a _starter_ template. These template include multiple projects, such as an API service, a web frontend, and an [Aspire AppHost](/get-started/app-host).

<Steps>

1. Create a new Aspire solution from a template:

    <Pivot id="csharp">

    ```bash title="Create a new aspire solution"
    aspire new aspire-starter -n AspireApp -o AspireApp
    ```

    </Pivot>
    <Pivot id="python">

    ```bash title="Create a new aspire solution"
    aspire new aspire-py-starter -n AspireApp -o AspireApp
    ```

    </Pivot>
    <Pivot id="javascript">

    ```bash title="Create a new aspire solution"
    aspire new aspire-js-starter -n AspireApp -o AspireApp
    ```

    </Pivot>

    <Aside type='tip' title='CLI options'>
      The template provides several projects, including an API service, web frontend, and AppHost.
      
      - `-n`: specifies the name of the solution.
      - `-o`: specifies the output directory.
    </Aside>

    If prompted for additional selections, use the <Kbd windows="↑" mac="↑" /> and <Kbd windows="↓" mac="↓" /> keys to navigate the options. 
    Press <Kbd windows="Enter" mac="Return" /> to confirm your selection.

1. Verify the solution was created successfully. The Aspire CLI creates a new folder named _AspireApp_ in the current directory. This folder contains the solution file and several projects, including:

    <Pivot id="csharp">
    <FileTree>
    - AspireApp.sln
    - AspireApp.ApiService
        - Properties/

            - .gitignore

            - index.html
            - package-lock.json
            - package.json
            - tsconfig.app.json
            - tsconfig.json
            - tsconfig.node.json
            - vite.config.ts
        - **apphost.cs** dev-time orchestrator
        - apphost.run.json
        - NuGet.config
    </FileTree>
    </Pivot>

    This solution structure is based on the Aspire templates. If they're not installed already, the CLI will install them for you.
</Steps>

## Run the app

import csharpDashboardLight from '@assets/get-started/csharp-aspire-dashboard-light.png';
import csharpDashboardDark from '@assets/get-started/csharp-aspire-dashboard-dark.png';
import pythonDashboardLight from '@assets/get-started/python-aspire-dashboard-light.png';
import pythonDashboardDark from '@assets/get-started/python-aspire-dashboard-dark.png';

<Steps>

1. Change to the _output_ directory:

    ```bash title="Change directories—stepping into the output directory"
    cd ./AspireApp
    ```

1. Call `aspire run` to start dev-time orchestration:

    ```bash title="Run dev-time orchestration"
    aspire run
    ```

    When you run this command, the Aspire CLI automatically finds the AppHost, builds your solution, and launches dev-time orchestration. Once the dashboard is ready, its URL (with a login token) appears in your console. You'll also see a live, real-time view of your running resources and their current states.

    <Pivot id="csharp">

    ```bash title="Example output of aspire run"
    🔍  Finding apphosts...
    AspireApp.AppHost\AspireApp.AppHost.csproj

    🗄  Created settings file at '.aspire/settings.json'.

         AppHost:  AspireApp.AppHost\AspireApp.AppHost.csproj

                   Press CTRL+C to stop the apphost and exit.
    ```

1. Explore the running distributed application. From the dashboard, open the `HTTPS` endpoint from each resource.

    <Pivot id="csharp">
        <ThemeImage 
            light={csharpDashboardLight}
            dark={csharpDashboardDark}
            label='Aspire dashboard Resources page'
            alt={`Aspire dashboard Resources page displaying two running resources: apiservice and webfrontend. Both are marked as Running with green check icons. The table lists columns for Name, State, Start time, Source, URLs, and Actions.`} />
    </Pivot>
    <Pivot id="python">
        <ThemeImage 
            light={pythonDashboardLight}
            dark={pythonDashboardDark}
            label='Aspire dashboard Resources page'
            alt={`Aspire dashboard Resources page displaying two running and two finished resources: apiservice and webfrontend. Two resources are marked as Running with green check icons while the two dependent resources show as Finished with gray stop icons. The table lists columns for Name, State, Start time, Source, URLs, and Actions.`} />
    </Pivot>

1. Stop the AppHost and close the dashboard by pressing <Kbd windows="Ctrl+C" mac="⌘+C" /> in your terminal.

    ```bash title="Stop dev-time orchestration"
    🛑  Stopping Aspire.
    ```

    **🥳 Congratulations! You've created your first Aspire app.**
