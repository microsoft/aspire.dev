In this quickstart, you'll create and run your first Aspire application using the Aspire CLI. This guide walks you through generating a new Aspire solution from a template, running the application locally with Aspire's dev-time orchestration, and exploring the Aspire dashboard.

## Create a new app

To create your first Aspire application, use the [Aspire CLI](/get-started/install-cli/) to generate a new solution from the `aspire-starter` template. This template includes multiple projects, including an API service, web frontend, and app host.

<Steps>

1. Create a new Aspire solution from a template:

    ```bash title="Create a new aspire solution" data-disable-copy
    aspire new aspire-starter -n AspireApp -o AspireApp
    ```

    <Aside type='tip' title='CLI options'>
      The `aspire-starter` template provides several projects, including an API service, web frontend, and app host.
      
      - `-n`: specifies the name of the solution.
      - `-o`: specifies the output directory.
    </Aside>

    If prompted for additional selections, use the <Kbd windows="↑" mac="↑" /> and <Kbd windows="↓" mac="↓" /> keys to navigate the options. 
    Press <Kbd windows="Enter" mac="Return" /> to confirm your selection.

         For further CLI reference, see [`aspire new`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-new/) command information.
    </LearnMore>

1. Verify the solution was created successfully. The Aspire CLI creates a new folder named _AspireApp_ in the current directory. This folder contains the solution file and several projects, including:

    <FileTree>
    - AspireApp.sln
    - AspireApp.ApiService
        - Properties/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.ApiService.csproj
        - Program.cs
    - **AspireApp.AppHost** this is your local **dev-time** orchestrator
        - Properties/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.AppHost.csproj
        - AppHost.cs
    - AspireApp.ServiceDefaults
        - Extensions.cs
        - AspireApp.ServiceDefaults.csproj
    - AspireApp.Web
        - Properties/
        - wwwroot/
        - appsettings.Development.json
        - appsettings.json
        - AspireApp.Web.csproj
        - Program.cs
        - WeatherApiClient.cs
    </FileTree>

    This solution structure is based on the Aspire templates. If they're not installed already, the CLI will install them for you.
</Steps>

## Run the app

<Steps>

1. Change to the _output_ directory:

    ```bash title="Change directories—stepping into the output directory"
    cd ./AspireApp
    ```

1. Call `aspire run` to start dev-time orchestration:

    ```bash title="Run dev-time orchestration"
    aspire run
    ```

    When you run this command, the Aspire CLI automatically finds the AppHost project, builds your solution, and launches dev-time orchestration. Once the dashboard is ready, its URL (with a login token) appears in your console. You'll also see a live, real-time view of your running resources and their current states.

    ```bash title="Example output of aspire run"
    Dashboard:  https://localhost:17244/login?t=9db79f2885dae24ee06c6ef10290b8b2

    Logs:  /home/vscode/.aspire/cli/logs/apphost-5932-2025-08-25-18-37-31.log

        Press CTRL+C to stop the apphost and exit.
    ```

1. Explore the running distributed application. From the dashboard, open the `HTTPS` endpoint from each resource.

    ![Aspire dashboard Resources page displaying two running resources: apiservice and webfrontend. Both are marked as Running with green check icons. The table lists columns for Name, State, Start time, Source, URLs, and Actions. apiservice uses AspireApp.ApiService.csproj and has URLs https://localhost:7393 and webfrontend uses AspireApp.Web.csproj with URL https://localhost:7214. The interface has a dark theme with navigation options for Resources, Console, Structured, Traces, and Metrics on the left.](../../../assets/get-started/aspire-dashboard.png)

1. Stop the AppHost and close the dashboard by pressing <Kbd windows="Ctrl+C" mac="⌘+C" />.

    **🥳 Congratulations! You've created your first Aspire app.**

## Next steps

Next, deepen your understanding of Aspire by learning how the AppHost defines your application's architecture, and how deployment and app topology are defined once and reused across environments.
