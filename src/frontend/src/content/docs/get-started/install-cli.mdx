Aspire includes tooling to help you create and configure cloud-native apps. The tooling includes useful starter project templates and other features to streamline getting started with Aspire for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and CLI workflows.

This article teaches you how to install the Aspire CLI, which is a CLI tool used to manage your Aspire solutions.

## Install as a native executable

The compiled version of the Aspire CLI can be installed using the [Aspire CLI installation script](/reference/cli/install-script/). The script is available for PowerShell and Bash.

<Steps>
01. Open a terminal.
01. Download the script and save it as a file:

    <Tabs syncKey="terminal">
        <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
            <Code
                lang="bash"
                code="curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh -o aspire-install.sh"
            />
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
            <Code
                lang="powershell"
                code='Invoke-RestMethod https://aspire.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile aspire-install.ps1'
            />
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

01. Run the script to install the stable release build of Aspire.

    You should see output similar to the following snippet:

    <Tabs syncKey="terminal">
        <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
            ```txt title="Output" frame="terminal"
            Downloading from: https://aka.ms/dotnet/9/aspire/ga/daily/aspire-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz
            Aspire CLI successfully installed to: /home/username/.aspire/bin/aspire
            Added /home/username/.aspire/bin to PATH for current session
            Added /home/username/.aspire/bin to PATH in /home/username/.bashrc
            
            The aspire cli is now available for use in this and new sessions.
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
            ```txt title="Output" frame="terminal"
            Downloading from: https://aka.ms/dotnet/9/aspire/ga/daily/aspire-cli-win-x64.zip
            Aspire CLI successfully installed to: C:\Users\name\.aspire\bin\aspire.exe
            Added C:\Users\username\.aspire\bin to PATH for current session
            Added C:\Users\username\.aspire\bin to user PATH environment variable
            
            The aspire cli is now available for use in this and new sessions.
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
</Steps>

:::tip
You can download and run the script in a single command:

<Tabs syncKey="terminal">
    <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
        <Code
            lang="bash"
            code="curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash"
        />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
        <Code
            lang="powershell"
            code='Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://aspire.dev/install.ps1) }"'
        />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install as a .NET global tool

Use the `dotnet tool` command to install the Aspire CLI global tool. The name of the global tool is [`Aspire.Cli`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.CLI).

<Steps>
01. Open a terminal.
01. Run the following command to install Aspire CLI:

    ```bash title=".NET CLI"
    dotnet tool install -g Aspire.Cli --prerelease
    ```
</Steps>

## Validation

To validate that the global tool is installed, use the `--version` option to query Aspire CLI for a version number:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire --version
```

If that command works, you're presented with the version of the Aspire CLI tool:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Output"
13.0.0
```

<LearnMore>
Learn more by reading the [Aspire CLI reference](/reference/cli/overview/) documentation.

:::note

If you're not seeing a version number, it's possible that your terminal session needs to be restarted to pick up the changes to your PATH environment variable. Simply close and reopen your terminal, then try running the `aspire --version` command again.
