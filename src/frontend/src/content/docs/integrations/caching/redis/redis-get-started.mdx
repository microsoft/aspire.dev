[Redis®](#registered-trademark) is the world's fastest data platform for caching, vector search, and NoSQL databases. The Aspire Redis integration enables you to connect to existing Redis instances, or create new instances from .NET with the [`docker.io/library/redis` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/).

<Aside>
  This page covers the Redis integration. For Garnet and Valkey
  (Redis-compatible alternatives), see their respective pages.
</Aside>

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Redis integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Redis hosting integration](/integrations/caching/redis/redis-host/) for full reference details.

<Aside type="note">
    To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](../../../../get-started/first-app/).
</Aside>

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Redis hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project:

<InstallPackage packageName="Aspire.Hosting.Redis" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create instances of Redis resources and pass them to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);

builder.Build().Run();
```

When Aspire adds a container image to the AppHost, it creates a new Redis instance on your local machine.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you'd rather connect to an existing Redis instance, call `AsExisting`
  instead.
</Aside>

## Set up client integration

To get started with the Aspire Redis client integration, install the package:

<InstallDotNetPackage packageName="Aspire.StackExchange.Redis" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddRedisClient` extension method to register an `IConnectionMultiplexer` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp
builder.AddRedisClient(connectionName: "cache");
```

<Aside type="tip">
  The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Redis
  resource in the AppHost project.
</Aside>

You can then retrieve the `IConnectionMultiplexer` instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IConnectionMultiplexer connectionMux)
{
    // Use connection multiplexer...
}
```
