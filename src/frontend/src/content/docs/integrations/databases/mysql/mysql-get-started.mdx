[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. It's employed in many different environments, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems and it's a popular choice to host data that underpins microservices in a cloud-native application. The Aspire MySQL integration provides a way to connect to existing MySQL databases, or create new instances from the [`mysql` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql).

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire MySQL integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [MySQL Hosting integration](../mysql-host/) for full reference details.

<Aside type="note">
    To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](../../../../get-started/first-app/).
</Aside>

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire MySQL Hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project. This integration allows you to create and manage MySQL database instances from your Aspire hosting projects:

<InstallPackage packageName="Aspire.Hosting.MySql" shortName="mysql" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create instances of MySQL server and database resources, then pass the database to the consuming client projects:

<PivotSelector
    title="Select your programming language to get started"
    key="lang"
    options={[
        { id: "csharp", title: "C#" },
        { id: "python", title: "Python" },
        { id: "javascript", title: "JavaScript" },
    ]}
/>

<Pivot id="csharp">

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var mysql = builder.AddMySql("mysql");
var mysqldb = mysql.AddDatabase("mysqldb");

var exampleProject = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>("apiservice")
                            .WaitFor(mysqldb)
                            .WithReference(mysqldb);
```

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="python">

```csharp title="apphost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var mysql = builder.AddMySql("mysql");
var mysqldb = mysql.AddDatabase("mysqldb");

var exampleProject = builder.AddUvicornApp("api", "./api", "main:app")
                            .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
                            .WaitFor(mysqldb)
                            .WithReference(mysqldb);
```

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="javascript">

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var mysql = builder.AddMySql("mysql");
var mysqldb = mysql.AddDatabase("mysqldb");

var api = builder.AddNodeApp("api", "./api", scriptPath: "index.js")
                 .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
                 .WaitFor(mysqldb)
                 .WithReference(mysqldb);
```

<Aside type="tip">
    This is the simplest implementation of MySQL resources in the AppHost. There are many more options you can choose from to address your requirements. For full details, see [MySQL Hosting integration](../mysql-host/).
</Aside>

## Use the integration in client projects

Now that the hosting integration is ready, the next step is to install and configure the client integration in any projects that need to use it.

### Set up client projects

<Pivot id="csharp">

In each of these consuming client projects, install the Aspire MySQL client integration:

<InstallDotNetPackage packageName="Aspire.MySqlConnector" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddMySqlDataSource` extension method on any `IHostApplicationBuilder` to register a `MySqlDataSource` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
builder.AddMySqlDataSource(connectionName: "mysqldb");
```

<Aside type="tip">
    The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the MySQL database resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Set up hosting integration](#set-up-hosting-integration).
</Aside>

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="python">

To interact with MySQL databases in your Python consuming projects, you need to include a MySQL adapter library. A popular option is `mysql-connector-python` (the official Oracle connector). You can install this library using pip:

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

Ensure that you import both `mysql.connector` and `os` in code files that interact with the database. Use `mysql.connector` to interact with the database and `os` to access environment variables:

```python title="Python - Import mysql.connector and os"
import mysql.connector
import os
```

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="javascript">

To interact with MySQL databases in your JavaScript consuming projects, you need to include a MySQL client library. A popular option is `mysql2` (a fast, modern MySQL client). You can install this library using npm:

```bash
npm install mysql2
```

Ensure that you import `mysql2` in code files that interact with the database. Use the `mysql2` library to access the database:

```javascript title="JavaScript - Import mysql2"
import mysql from 'mysql2/promise';
```

</Pivot>

### Use injected MySQL properties

In the AppHost, when you used the `WithReference` method to pass a MySQL server or database resource to a consuming client project, Aspire injects several configuration properties that you can use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `mysqldb` becomes `MYSQLDB_URI`.

<Pivot id="csharp">

Use the `GetValue()` method to obtain these environment variables in consuming projects:

```csharp title="C# - Obtain configuration properties"
string hostname = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("MYSQLDB_HOST");
string databaseport = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("MYSQLDB_PORT");
string jdbcconnectionstring = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("MYSQLDB_JDBCCONNECTIONSTRING");
string databasename = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("MYSQLDB_DATABASE");
```

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="python">

Use the `os.getenv()` method to obtain these environment variables in consuming projects:

```python title="Python - Obtain configuration properties"
mysql_host = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_HOST")
mysql_port = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_PORT")
mysql_user = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_USERNAME")
mysql_password = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_PASSWORD")
mysql_database = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_DATABASE")
mysql_uri = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_URI")
mysql_name = os.getenv("MYSQLDB_DATABASE", "mysqldb")
```

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="javascript">

Use the `process.env` method to obtain these environment variables in consuming projects:

```javascript title="JavaScript - Obtain configuration properties"
const mysqlHost = process.env.MYSQLDB_HOST;
const mysqlPort = process.env.MYSQLDB_PORT;
const mysqlUser = process.env.MYSQLDB_USERNAME;
const mysqlPassword = process.env.MYSQLDB_PASSWORD;
const mysqlDatabase = process.env.MYSQLDB_DATABASE;
```

</Pivot>

<Aside type="tip">
    The full set of properties that Aspire injects depends on whether you passed a MySQL server or database resource. For more information, see [Properties of the MySQL resources](../mysql-client/#properties-of-the-mysql-resources).
</Aside>

### Use MySQL resources in client code

<Pivot id="csharp">

Now that you've added `MySqlDataSource` to the builder in the consuming project, you can use the MySQL resource to get and store data. Get the `MySqlDataSource` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve your data source object from an example service define it as a constructor parameter and ensure the `ExampleService` class is registered with the dependency injection container:

```csharp title="C# — ExampleService.cs"
public class ExampleService(MySqlDataSource dataSource)
{
    // Use dataSource to query the database...
}
```

Having obtained the data source, you can work with the MySQL database as you would in any other C# application.

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="python">

Use the information you have obtained about the MySQL resource to connect to the database. Here is an example of how to connect using `mysql-connector-python`:

```python title="Python - Connect to MySQL"
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host=mysql_host,
    port=mysql_port,
    user=mysql_user,
    password=mysql_password,
    database=mysql_database
)

cursor = connection.cursor()
```

Having obtained the connection, you can work with the MySQL database as you would in any other Python application.

</Pivot>

<Pivot id="javascript">

Use the information you have obtained about the MySQL resource to connect to the database. Here is an example of how to connect using `mysql2`:

```javascript title="JavaScript - Connect to MySQL"
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
  host: mysqlHost,
  port: mysqlPort,
  user: mysqlUser,
  password: mysqlPassword,
  database: mysqlDatabase
});
```

Having obtained the connection, you can work with the MySQL database as you would in any other JavaScript application.

</Pivot>
