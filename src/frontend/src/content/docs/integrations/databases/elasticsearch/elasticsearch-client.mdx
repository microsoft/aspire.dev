To get started with the Aspire Elasticsearch client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch) NuGet package:

<InstallDotNetPackage packageName="Aspire.Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch" />

The Elasticsearch client integration registers an [ElasticsearchClient](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net) instance that you can use to interact with Elasticsearch.

For an introduction to the Elasticsearch integration, see [Get started with the Elasticsearch integrations](../elasticsearch-get-started/).

## Add Elasticsearch client

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddElasticsearchClient` extension method to register an `ElasticsearchClient` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp
builder.AddElasticsearchClient(connectionName: "elasticsearch");
```

<Aside type="tip">
  The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the
  Elasticsearch resource in the AppHost project.
</Aside>

You can then retrieve the `ElasticsearchClient` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(ElasticsearchClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

## Add keyed Elasticsearch client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `ElasticsearchClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Elasticsearch clients, call the `AddKeyedElasticsearchClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedElasticsearchClient(name: "products");
builder.AddKeyedElasticsearchClient(name: "orders");
```

Then you can retrieve the `ElasticsearchClient` instances using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("products")] ElasticsearchClient productsClient,
    [FromKeyedServices("orders")] ElasticsearchClient ordersClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information on keyed services, see [.NET dependency injection: Keyed services](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

## Properties of the Elasticsearch resources

When you add a reference to an Elasticsearch resource in the AppHost, using the `WithReference` method, Aspire injects several properties into the consuming project. These properties are available as environment variables that you can use to connect to and interact with Elasticsearch.

The following table describes the properties that are injected:

| Property Name | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `Endpoint` | `ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT` | The HTTP endpoint URL for connecting to the Elasticsearch instance. |

Here's an example of how these properties are used when you call `WithReference`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var elasticsearch = builder.AddElasticsearch("elasticsearch");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(elasticsearch);
```

In this example, the `ExampleProject` will have access to the `ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT` environment variable, which contains the connection string to the Elasticsearch instance.

## Configuration

The Elasticsearch integration provides multiple options to configure the server connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling `AddElasticsearchClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddElasticsearchClient("elasticsearch");
```

Then the connection string will be retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "elasticsearch": "http://elastic:password@localhost:27011"
  }
}
```

### Use configuration providers

The Elasticsearch integration supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `ElasticClientsElasticsearchSettings` from configuration using the `Aspire:Elastic:Clients:Elasticsearch` key. Example `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Elastic": {
      "Clients": {
        "Elasticsearch": {
          "DisableHealthChecks": false,
          "DisableTracing": false,
          "HealthCheckTimeout": "00:00:03",
          "ApiKey": "<Valid ApiKey>",
          "Endpoint": "http://elastic:password@localhost:27011",
          "CloudId": "<Valid CloudId>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use inline delegates

You can pass the `Action<ElasticClientsElasticsearchSettings>` delegate to set up options inline:

```csharp
builder.AddElasticsearchClient(
    "elasticsearch",
    static settings =>
        settings.Endpoint = new Uri("http://elastic:password@localhost:27011"));
```

### Use CloudId and ApiKey with configuration providers

When using [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud), you can provide the `CloudId` and `ApiKey` in the configuration:

```csharp
builder.AddElasticsearchClient("elasticsearch");
```

Example `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Elastic": {
      "Clients": {
        "Elasticsearch": {
          "ApiKey": "<Valid ApiKey>",
          "CloudId": "<Valid CloudId>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use CloudId and ApiKey with inline delegates

```csharp
builder.AddElasticsearchClient(
    "elasticsearch",
    static settings =>
    {
        settings.ApiKey = "<Valid ApiKey>";
        settings.CloudId = "<Valid CloudId>";
    });
```

## Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire integrations enable health checks for all services. The Elasticsearch integration uses the configured client to perform a `PingAsync`. If the result is an HTTP 200 OK, the health check is considered healthy, otherwise it's unhealthy.

## Observability and telemetry

### Tracing

The Elasticsearch integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Elastic.Transport`
