[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with many years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. The Aspire PostgreSQL integration provides a way to connect to existing PostgreSQL databases, or create new instances from the [`docker.io/library/postgres` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire PostgreSQL integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [PostgreSQL Hosting integration](../postgres-host/) for full reference details.

<Aside type="note">
    To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](../../../../get-started/first-app/).
</Aside>

## Set up the hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire PostgreSQL Hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project. This integration allows you to create and manage PostgreSQL database instances from your Aspire hosting projects:

<InstallPackage packageName="Aspire.Hosting.PostgreSQL" shortName="postgresql" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create instances of PostgreSQL server and database resources, then pass the database to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var postgres = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var postgresdb = postgres.AddDatabase("postgresdb");

var exampleProject = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                            .WithReference(postgresdb);
```

<Aside type="tip">
    This is the simplest implementation of PostgreSQL resources in the AppHost. There are many more options you can choose from to address your requirements. For full details, see [PostgreSQL Hosting integration](../postgres-host/).
</Aside>

## Configuration properties of the PostgreSQL resources

When you use the `WithReference` method to pass a PostgreSQL server or database resource from the AppHost project to a consuming client project, Aspire injects several configuration properties that you can use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `db1` becomes `DB1_URI`.

### PostgreSQL server resource

The PostgreSQL server resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Host` | The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server |
| `Port` | The port number the PostgreSQL server is listening on |
| `Username` | The username for authentication |
| `Password` | The password for authentication |
| `Uri` | The connection URI in postgresql:// format, with the format `postgresql://{Username}:{Password}@{Host}:{Port}` |
| `JdbcConnectionString` | JDBC-format connection string, with the format `jdbc:postgresql://{Host}:{Port}`. User and password credentials are provided as separate `Username` and `Password` properties. |

### PostgreSQL database resource

The PostgreSQL database resource inherits all properties from its parent `PostgresServerResource` and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Uri` | The connection URI with the database name, with the format `postgresql://{Username}:{Password}@{Host}:{Port}/{DatabaseName}` |
| `JdbcConnectionString` | JDBC connection string with database name, with the format `jdbc:postgresql://{Host}:{Port}/{DatabaseName}`. User and password credentials are provided as separate `Username` and `Password` properties. |
| `Database` | The name of the database |

## Set up the client integration

Now that the hosting integration is ready, the next step is to install and configure the client integration in any projects that need to use it.

In each of these consuming client projects, install the Aspire PostgreSQL client integration:

<InstallDotNetPackage packageName="Aspire.Npgsql" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddNpgsqlDataSource` extension method on any `IHostApplicationBuilder` to register an `NpgsqlDataSource` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
builder.AddNpgsqlDataSource(connectionName: "postgresdb");
```

<Aside type="tip">
    The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the PostgreSQL server resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Add PostgreSQL server resource](#add-postgresql-server-resource).
</Aside>

After adding `NpgsqlDataSource` to the builder, you can get the `NpgsqlDataSource` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve your data source object from an example service define it as a constructor parameter and ensure the `ExampleService` class is registered with the dependency injection container:

```csharp title="C# — ExampleService.cs"
public class ExampleService(NpgsqlDataSource dataSource)
{
    // Use dataSource...
}
```

## Completed solution

import postgresqlDashboardLight from '@assets/integrations/postgresql/postgresql-dashboard-light.png';
import postgresqlDashboardDark from '@assets/integrations/postgresql/postgresql-dashboard-dark.png';

In an Aspire solution that uses the PostgreSQL integrations, the **Resources** page includes the PostgreSQL instance:

<ThemeImage 
    light={postgresqlDashboardLight}
    dark={postgresqlDashboardDark}
    label='Aspire dashboard Resources page'
    alt={`Aspire dashboard Resources page displaying PostgreSQL resources. Both are marked as Running with green check icons. The table lists columns for Name, State, Start time, Source, URLs, and Actions.`} />

## Next steps

Now, that you have an Aspire app with PostgreSQL integrations up and running, you can use the following reference documents to learn how to configure and interact with the PostgreSQL resources:
