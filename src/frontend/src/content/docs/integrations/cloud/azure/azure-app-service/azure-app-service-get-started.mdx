[Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service) is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. Aspire apps often run locally during development but require scalable, production-ready hosting environments for staging and production. The Aspire integration allows you to provision or reference an existing Azure App Service environment (App Service Plan) and seamlessly publish your container, executable, and project resources as Azure App Service websites.

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Azure App Service integration in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Azure App Service Hosting integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-app-service/azure-app-service-host/) for full reference details.

<Aside type="note">
    To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](/get-started/first-app/).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Azure App Service Hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project:

<InstallPackage packageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService" />

Next, add an App Service environment to your AppHost project. The environment represents the hosting infrastructure (App Service Plan) where your apps will run:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var appServiceEnv = builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("app-service-env");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApi>("api")
    .PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, website) =>
    {
        // Optional: customize the Azure App Service website here
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

<Aside type="caution">
  When you call `AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment`, it implicitly calls
  `AddAzureProvisioning`—which adds support for generating Azure resources
  dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate
  subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning:
  Configuration](/integrations/cloud/azure/local-provisioning/#configuration).
</Aside>

The preceding code:

- Creates an Azure App Service environment named `app-service-env`.
- Adds a project named `api` to the AppHost.
- Configures the project to be published as an Azure App Service website.
- Provides an optional callback to customize the website configuration.

During local development (when running with <Kbd windows='F5' mac='F5' />), the project runs locally. When you publish your app, the project is deployed as an Azure App Service website within the provisioned environment.
