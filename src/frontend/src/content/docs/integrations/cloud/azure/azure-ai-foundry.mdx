[Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai-studio) provides a unified platform for developing, testing, and deploying AI applications. The Aspire Azure AI Foundry integration enables you to connect to Azure AI Foundry services from your applications, providing access to various AI capabilities including model deployments, prompt flow, and more.

## Hosting integration

The Aspire Azure AI Foundry hosting integration models the AI Foundry project as the `AzureAIFoundryResource` type. To access this type and APIs for expressing them within your AppHost project, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry) NuGet package:

<InstallPackage packageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry" />

### Add an Azure AI Foundry resource

To add an Azure AI Foundry resource to your AppHost project, call the `AddAzureAIFoundry` method providing a name:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var aiFoundry = builder.AddAzureAIFoundry("ai-foundry");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(aiFoundry);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code adds an Azure AI Foundry resource named `ai-foundry` to the AppHost project. The `WithReference` method passes the connection information to the `ExampleProject` project.

### Connect to an existing Azure AI Foundry project

You might have an existing Azure AI Foundry project that you want to connect to. You can chain a call to annotate that your `AzureAIFoundryResource` is an existing resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var existingProjectName = builder.AddParameter("existingProjectName");
var existingProjectResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingProjectResourceGroup");

var aiFoundry = builder.AddAzureAIFoundry("ai-foundry")
                       .AsExisting(existingProjectName, existingProjectResourceGroup);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(aiFoundry);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

For more information on treating Azure AI Foundry resources as existing resources, see [Use existing Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/integrations-overview/#use-existing-azure-resources).

## Client integration

The client integration for Azure AI Foundry is the [Azure AI Inference](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-inference/) integration.
