Azure App Service is a hosting integration only. There is no separate client integration package required to run your applications on Azure App Service.

When you use the `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` method in your AppHost, your application code runs directly on the Azure App Service platform without needing additional client libraries or configuration changes.

Your application will continue to use the same client integrations for other services (like databases, caches, message queues) as it does during local development. The Azure App Service integration automatically handles the deployment and hosting aspects.

For more information on configuring resources to run on Azure App Service, see [Azure App Service Hosting integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-app-service/azure-app-service-host/).
