[Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service) provides access to OpenAI's powerful language and embedding models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. The Aspire Azure OpenAI integration enables you to connect to Azure OpenAI services from your applications.

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Azure OpenAI integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Azure OpenAI Hosting integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-openai/azure-openai-host/) for full reference details.

<Aside type="note">
    To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](/get-started/first-app/).
</Aside>

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Azure OpenAI Hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project. This integration allows you to create and manage Azure OpenAI resources from your Aspire hosting projects:

<InstallPackage packageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CognitiveServices" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create an Azure OpenAI resource and pass it to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var openai = builder.AddAzureOpenAI("openai");

openai.AddDeployment(
    name: "preview",
    modelName: "gpt-4.5-preview",
    modelVersion: "2025-02-27");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(openai)
       .WaitFor(openai);

// After adding all resources, run the app...

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code adds an Azure OpenAI resource named `openai` to the AppHost project, configures a deployment with a specific model, and passes the connection information to the `ExampleProject` project.

<Aside type="caution">
  When you call `AddAzureOpenAI`, it implicitly calls
  `AddAzureProvisioning`—which adds support for generating Azure resources
  dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate
  subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning:
  Configuration](/integrations/cloud/azure/local-provisioning/#configuration).
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
    This is the simplest implementation of Azure OpenAI resources in the AppHost. There are many more options you can choose from to address your requirements. For full details, see [Azure OpenAI Hosting integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-openai/azure-openai-host/).
</Aside>

## Set up client integration

To use Azure OpenAI from your client applications, install the Aspire Azure OpenAI client integration in your client project:

<InstallDotNetPackage packageName="Aspire.Azure.AI.OpenAI" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureOpenAIClient` extension method to register an `AzureOpenAIClient` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureOpenAIClient(connectionName: "openai");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the OpenAI resource in the AppHost project.

After adding the `AzureOpenAIClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(AzureOpenAIClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For full details on using the client integration, see [Azure OpenAI Client integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-openai/azure-openai-client/).
