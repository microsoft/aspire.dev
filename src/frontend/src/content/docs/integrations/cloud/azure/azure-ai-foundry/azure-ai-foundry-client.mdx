The client integration for Azure AI Foundry is provided through the [Azure AI Inference](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-inference/azure-ai-inference-get-started/) integration.

For an introduction to working with the Azure AI Foundry client integration, see [Get started with the Azure AI Foundry integrations](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-foundry/azure-ai-foundry-get-started/).

## Using Azure AI Foundry from client applications

To use Azure AI Foundry services from your client applications, you'll use the Azure AI Inference client integration. This integration provides a consistent way to interact with various AI models deployed in Azure AI Foundry, including chat completions, embeddings, and other AI capabilities.

For detailed information on how to:

- Install the Azure AI Inference client package
- Configure the client in your application
- Use chat completions and other AI features
- Handle authentication and connection strings

See the complete [Azure AI Inference integration documentation](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-inference/azure-ai-inference-get-started/).
