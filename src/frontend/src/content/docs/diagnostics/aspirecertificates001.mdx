This diagnostic warning is reported when using experimental certificate configuration APIs in Aspire, including:

- `IDeveloperCertificateService` interface
- `HttpsCertificateAnnotation` class
- Certificate-related extension methods like `WithHttpsCertificate`, `WithHttpsDeveloperCertificate`, `WithoutHttpsCertificate`
- Certificate configuration builder extensions like `WithHttpsCertificateConfig` and `WithHttpsCertificateConfiguration`

These APIs enable configuring HTTPS/TLS server certificates for resources in your Aspire application, including support for custom certificates and developer certificates for local development scenarios.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIRECERTIFICATES001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Using developer certificate
builder.AddViteApp("frontend")
    .WithHttpsDeveloperCertificate();

// Using a custom certificate
var certificate = new X509Certificate2("path/to/certificate.pfx", "password");
builder.AddYarp("gateway")
    .WithHttpsCertificate(certificate);

// Disabling HTTPS certificate configuration
builder.AddRedis("cache")
    .WithoutHttpsCertificate();

// Using IDeveloperCertificateService
var developerCertService = builder.Services
    .BuildServiceProvider()
    .GetRequiredService<IDeveloperCertificateService>();
```

## Understanding certificate configuration

Aspire 13.1 introduced TLS termination support APIs that allow you to configure HTTPS certificates for resources that need to terminate TLS connections. Several containers have built-in TLS termination support:

| Container         | Default |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| YARP              | Enabled |
| Redis             | Enabled |
| Keycloak          | Enabled |
| Uvicorn (Python)  | Enabled |
| Vite (JavaScript) | Opt-in  |

When TLS is enabled by default, the ASP.NET Core developer certificate is automatically used if available and trusted.

### Developer certificate configuration

The `IDeveloperCertificateService` provides information about developer certificates:

- **`Certificates`** — List of valid development certificates available for trust
- **`SupportsContainerTrust`** — Indicates if certificates support container domains like `host.docker.internal`
- **`UseForHttps`** — Indicates if developer certificates should be used for TLS termination by default
- **`TrustCertificate`** — Indicates if certificates should be trusted at runtime by default

## To suppress this warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIRECERTIFICATES001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIRECERTIFICATES001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIRECERTIFICATES001` directive:

  ```csharp title="C# — Suppressing the warning"
  #pragma warning disable ASPIRECERTIFICATES001
  var developerCertService = builder.Services
      .BuildServiceProvider()
      .GetRequiredService<IDeveloperCertificateService>();
  #pragma warning restore ASPIRECERTIFICATES001
  ```
