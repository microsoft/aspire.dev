title: ASPIREEXTENSION001
description: The extension debugging support APIs are experimental and subject to change.
---

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Diagnostic ID** | ASPIREEXTENSION001 |
| **Severity** | Warning |
| **Category** | Usage |

The `WithDebugSupport` extension method and related APIs for enabling debugging support in IDE extensions are experimental features. These APIs may change or be removed in future versions.

## Cause

This warning appears when you use APIs for adding debug support to resources:

- `WithDebugSupport<T, TLaunchConfiguration>` extension method
- `SupportsDebuggingAnnotation`

These APIs are primarily used by integration authors to enable F5 debugging for custom resource types in Visual Studio and other IDEs.

## How to suppress

If you understand the experimental nature of these APIs and want to use them, suppress the warning:

```csharp title="Suppress in code"
#pragma warning disable ASPIREEXTENSION001
builder.AddMyResource("resource")
    .WithDebugSupport(
        processId => new MyLaunchConfiguration { ProcessId = processId },
        "myResourceType");
#pragma warning restore ASPIREEXTENSION001
```

Or in your project file:

```xml title="Suppress in project file"
<PropertyGroup>
  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREEXTENSION001</NoWarn>
</PropertyGroup>
```
