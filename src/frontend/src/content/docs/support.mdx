## Overview

.NET Aspire follows the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy). This policy requires users to stay current with the latest version to receive support and servicing updates. When a new major or minor release is made available, the previous version is no longer supported.

## Support Lifecycle

### Supported Versions

- Only the **latest released version** of .NET Aspire is supported at any given time.
- Support for a version ends when the next major or minor release becomes available.
- You must update to the newest version to continue receiving support and servicing updates.

### Release Cadence

- **Major releases** occur approximately once per year
- **Minor releases** are published throughout the year
- Each release may include both security and non-security fixes

## Servicing Updates

Servicing updates for .NET Aspire may be released monthly and can include:

- Security fixes
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Non-breaking changes

:::note
If there are no servicing updates in a given month, no patch release will be published.

## Container Support

.NET Aspire can integrate with third-party containers. However:

- The Aspire team does not vet third-party containers for specific requirements
