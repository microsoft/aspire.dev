## Microsoft support for Aspire

Every Microsoft product has a lifecycle, including Aspire. The lifecycle begins when a product is released and ends when it is no longer supported. Knowing key dates in this lifecycle helps you make informed decisions about when to upgrade or make other changes to your software. This product is governed by the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle) policy.

The Aspire support policy follows the Microsoft Modern Lifecycle with unique versioning and support policies specific to Aspire releases.

## Release cadence

Aspire ships roughly a new major release every year with various minor releases throughout the year.

## Versioning and support

At any time, only the latest release of Aspire is supported by Microsoft. For example: support for Aspire 8.0 ended when Aspire 8.1 was released.

To receive technical support from Microsoft, you need to be on the latest servicing level (update) for the latest Aspire release.

## Servicing updates

Servicing updates may be made available for supported versions of Aspire. Aspire updates may include a mix of security and non-security fixes in a single patch update. In months without a patch update, a release might not occur.

## Support of containers used by Aspire

Aspire enables the use of third-party containers through resources and integrations. The Aspire team cannot evaluate the underlying third-party containers for which we have API support for suitability for specific customer requirements.

You should evaluate whichever containers you choose to compose and automate with Aspire to ensure they meet your, your employer's, or your government's requirements on security and safety as well as cryptographic regulations and any other regulatory or corporate standards that may apply to your use of the container.

Updates to Aspire will from time to time bring updates to third-party containers.
