The [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview/) provides a great user experience for viewing telemetry, and is available as a standalone container image that can be used with any OpenTelemetry-enabled app. In this article, you'll learn how to:

- Start the Aspire dashboard in standalone mode.
- Use the Aspire dashboard with a Python app.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/).
  - You can use an alternative container runtime, but the commands in this article are for Docker.
- [Python 3.9 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) locally installed.
- A sample application.

## Sample application

This tutorial can be completed using either Flask or FastAPI. A sample application in each framework is provided to help you follow along with this tutorial. Download or clone the sample application to your local workstation.

<Pivot id="flask">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-flask-webapp-quickstart
```

</Pivot>
<Pivot id="fastapi">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-fastapi-webapp-quickstart.git
```

</Pivot>

To run the application locally, follow the framework-specific instructions for Flask or FastAPI.

## Adding OpenTelemetry

To use the Aspire dashboard with your Python app, you need to install the OpenTelemetry SDK and exporter. The OpenTelemetry SDK provides the API for instrumenting your application, and the exporter sends telemetry data to the Aspire dashboard.

<Steps>
1. Install the OpenTelemetry SDK and exporter:

    ```bash
    pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
    ```

1. Add a new file to your application called `otlp_tracing.py` and add OpenTelemetry configuration code.

1. Update your application to include the imports and call the OpenTelemetry configuration function.

1. Restart your application.
</Steps>

### Framework Specific Instrumentation

This instrumentation has only focused on adding OpenTelemetry to our code. For more detailed instrumentation, you can use the OpenTelemetry Instrumentation packages for the specific frameworks that you are using.

<Pivot id="flask">

<Steps>
1. Install the Flask instrumentation package:

    ```bash
    pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask
    ```

1. Add the Flask instrumentation to your application code.
</Steps>

</Pivot>
<Pivot id="fastapi">

<Steps>
1. Install the FastAPI instrumentation package:

    ```bash
    pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi
    ```

1. Add the FastAPI instrumentation to your application code.
</Steps>

</Pivot>

## Start the Aspire dashboard

To start the Aspire dashboard in standalone mode, run the following Docker command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 --name aspire-dashboard \
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest
```

In the Docker logs, the endpoint and key for the dashboard are displayed. Copy the key and navigate to `http://localhost:18888` in a web browser. Enter the key to log in to the dashboard.

## View structured logs

Navigate around the Python application, and you'll see structured logs in the Aspire dashboard. The structured logs page displays logs from your application, and you can filter and search the logs.

## Next steps

You have successfully used the Aspire dashboard with a Python application. To learn more about the Aspire dashboard, see the [Aspire dashboard overview](/dashboard/overview/) and how to orchestrate a Python application with the Aspire AppHost.
