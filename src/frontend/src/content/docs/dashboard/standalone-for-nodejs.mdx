The [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview/) provides a great user experience for viewing telemetry, and is available as a standalone container image that can be used with any OpenTelemetry-enabled app. In this article, you'll learn how to:

- Start the Aspire dashboard in standalone mode.
- Use the Aspire dashboard with a Node.js app.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/).
  - You can use an alternative container runtime, but the commands in this article are for Docker.
- [Node.js 18 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) locally installed.
- A sample application.

## Sample application

This tutorial uses an Express.js application to demonstrate the integration. You can either create a new Express.js app or use an existing Node.js application.

To create a new Express.js application:

<Steps>
1. Create a new directory for your application:

    ```console
    mkdir aspire-nodejs-sample
    cd aspire-nodejs-sample
    ```

1. Initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```npm
    npm init -y
    ```

1. Install Express.js:

    ```npm
    npm install express
    ```

1. Create a basic Express.js application by creating an *app.js* file with Express server code.

1. Test the application by running:

    ```console
    npm start
    ```

1. Browse to the application at `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser to verify it's working.
</Steps>

## Adding OpenTelemetry

To use the Aspire dashboard with your Node.js app, you need to install the OpenTelemetry SDK and exporter. The OpenTelemetry SDK provides the API for instrumenting your application, and the exporter sends telemetry data to the Aspire dashboard.

1. Create a new file called *tracing.js* to configure OpenTelemetry.

1. Update your *app.js* to import the tracing configuration at the very beginning.

1. Restart your application:

    ```console
    npm start
    ```

## Start the Aspire dashboard

To start the Aspire dashboard in standalone mode, run the following Docker command:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bash">

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 --name aspire-dashboard \
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.5
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="PowerShell">

```powershell
docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 --name aspire-dashboard `
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.5
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the Docker logs, the endpoint and key for the dashboard are displayed. Copy the key and navigate to `http://localhost:18888` in a web browser. Enter the key to log in to the dashboard.

## View telemetry in the dashboard

After starting both the dashboard and your Node.js application, you can view telemetry data by making requests to your application and observing the results in the dashboard.

1. Make some requests to your Node.js application:

    ```console
    curl http://localhost:3000/
    curl http://localhost:3000/api/weather
    ```

1. Navigate to the Aspire dashboard at <http://localhost:18888> and explore the different sections:

### Traces

The **Traces** page shows distributed traces for HTTP requests. Each request to your Express.js application creates a trace that you can explore to see the request flow and timing information.

### Metrics

The **Metrics** page displays various metrics collected from your Node.js application, including HTTP request metrics, Node.js runtime metrics, and custom metrics if you choose to add them.

## Adding custom telemetry

You can enhance your application with custom spans, logs, and metrics by updating your application code.

## Next steps

You have successfully used the Aspire dashboard with a Node.js application. To learn more about the Aspire dashboard, see the [Aspire dashboard overview](/dashboard/overview/) and how to orchestrate a Node.js application with the Aspire AppHost.
