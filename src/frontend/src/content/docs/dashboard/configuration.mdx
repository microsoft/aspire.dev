The dashboard is configured when it starts up. Configuration includes frontend and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) addresses, the resource service endpoint, authentication, telemetry limits, and more.

When the dashboard is launched with the Aspire AppHost project, it's automatically configured to display the app's resources and telemetry. Configuration is provided when launching the dashboard in [standalone mode](overview#standalone-mode).

There are many ways to provide configuration:

- Command line arguments.
- Environment variables. The `:` delimiter should be replaced with double underscore (`__`) in environment variable names.
- Optional JSON configuration file. The `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_CONFIG_FILE_PATH` setting can be used to specify a JSON configuration file.

Consider the following example, which shows how to configure the dashboard when started from a Docker container:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 -d --name aspire-dashboard \
    -e DASHBOARD__TELEMETRYLIMITS__MAXLOGCOUNT='1000' \
    -e DASHBOARD__TELEMETRYLIMITS__MAXTRACECOUNT='1000' \
    -e DASHBOARD__TELEMETRYLIMITS__MAXMETRICSCOUNT='1000' \
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.5
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="PowerShell"icon="seti:powershell">

```powershell
docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 -d --name aspire-dashboard `
    -e DASHBOARD__TELEMETRYLIMITS__MAXLOGCOUNT='1000' `
    -e DASHBOARD__TELEMETRYLIMITS__MAXTRACECOUNT='1000' `
    -e DASHBOARD__TELEMETRYLIMITS__MAXMETRICSCOUNT='1000' `
    mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:9.5
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, these same values could be configured using a JSON configuration file that is specified using `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`:

```json
{
  "Dashboard": {
    "TelemetryLimits": {
      "MaxLogCount": 1000,
      "MaxTraceCount": 1000,
      "MaxMetricsCount": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="caution">
The dashboard displays information about resources, including their configuration, console logs and in-depth telemetry.

Data displayed in the dashboard can be sensitive. For example, secrets in environment variables, and sensitive runtime data in telemetry. Care should be taken to configure the dashboard to secure access.

Configuration described on this page is for the standalone dashboard. To configure an Aspire AppHost project, see AppHost configuration.

## Common configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS`<br/>Default: `http://localhost:18888` | One or more HTTP endpoints through which the dashboard frontend is served. The frontend endpoint is used to view the dashboard in a browser. When the dashboard is launched by the Aspire AppHost this address is secured with HTTPS. Securing the dashboard with HTTPS is recommended. |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL`<br/>Default: `http://localhost:18889` | The [OTLP/gRPC](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlpgrpc) endpoint. This endpoint hosts an OTLP service and receives telemetry using gRPC. When the dashboard is launched by the Aspire AppHost this address is secured with HTTPS. Securing the dashboard with HTTPS is recommended. |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL`<br/>Default: `http://localhost:18890` | The [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/#otlphttp) endpoint. This endpoint hosts an OTLP service and receives telemetry using Protobuf over HTTP. When the dashboard is launched by the Aspire AppHost the OTLP/HTTP endpoint isn't configured by default. To configure an OTLP/HTTP endpoint with the AppHost, set an `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` env var value in _launchSettings.json_. Securing the dashboard with HTTPS is recommended. |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`<br/>Default: `false` | Configures the dashboard to not use authentication and accepts anonymous access. This setting is a shortcut to configuring `Dashboard:Frontend:AuthMode` and `Dashboard:Otlp:AuthMode` to `Unsecured`. |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`<br/>Default: `null` | The path for a JSON configuration file. If the dashboard is being run in a Docker container, then this is the path to the configuration file in a mounted volume. This value is optional. |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_FILE_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`<br/>Default: `null` | The directory where the dashboard looks for key-per-file configuration. This value is optional. |
| `ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL`<br/>Default: `null` | The gRPC endpoint to which the dashboard connects for its data. If this value is unspecified, the dashboard shows telemetry data but no resource list or console logs. This setting is a shortcut to `Dashboard:ResourceServiceClient:Url`. |

<Aside>
Additional configuration sections (Frontend authentication, OTLP authentication, OTLP CORS, Resources, Telemetry limits, and Other) have been omitted for brevity. Please refer to the full documentation or the original source for complete configuration options.
