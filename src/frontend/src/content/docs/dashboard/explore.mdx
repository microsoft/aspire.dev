In the upcoming sections, you discover how to create an Aspire project and embark on the following tasks:

- Investigate the dashboard's capabilities by using the app generated from the project template as explained in the [Quickstart: Build your first Aspire project.](/get-started/first-app)
- Delve into the features of the Aspire dashboard app.

The screenshots featured in this article showcase the dark theme. For more information on theme selection, see [Theme selection](#theme-selection).

The Aspire dashboard also includes **GitHub Copilot**, your AI debugging assistant, which can help you analyze resources, logs, traces, and telemetry data. Copilot is available when you launch your app from VS Code or Visual Studio with a GitHub account that has a Copilot subscription. For complete details, see [GitHub Copilot in the Aspire dashboard](copilot).

## Dashboard authentication

When you run an Aspire AppHost, the orchestrator starts up all the app's dependent resources and then opens a browser window to the dashboard. The Aspire dashboard requires token-based authentication for its users because it displays environment variables and other sensitive information.

When the dashboard is launched from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (with the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)), the browser is automatically logged in, and the dashboard opens directly. This is the typical developer F5 experience, and the authentication login flow is automated by the Aspire tooling.

However, if you start the AppHost from the command line, you're presented with the login page. The console window displays a URL that you can select on to open the dashboard in your browser.
