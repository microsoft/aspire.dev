## Name

`aspire wait` - Wait for a resource to reach a target status.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire wait <resource> [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire wait` command blocks until a named resource within a running AppHost reaches a target status. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows where you need to wait for resources to be ready after starting an AppHost with `aspire run --detach`.

The command connects to a running AppHost via the backchannel and streams resource state changes in real-time. It validates that the specified resource exists before entering the wait loop, so typos in resource names are caught immediately rather than causing a silent timeout.

When executed without the `--project` option, the command:

1. Scans for all running AppHost processes.
2. If multiple AppHosts are running within the current directory scope, prompts you to select which one to target.
3. If only one AppHost is running in scope, connects to it directly.
4. If no in-scope AppHosts are found but out-of-scope AppHosts exist, displays all running AppHosts for selection.

## Arguments

- **`<resource>`**

  The name of the resource to wait for. This must match the name of a resource defined in the running AppHost.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--status <healthy|up|down>`**

  The target status to wait for. Defaults to `healthy`. The following values are supported:

  | Value | Condition |
  |-------|-----------|
  | `healthy` | Resource is running and healthy, or running with no health checks configured |
  | `up` | Resource is running, regardless of health status |
  | `down` | Resource has finished, exited, or failed to start |

  Values are case-insensitive.

- **`--timeout <seconds>`**

  The maximum number of seconds to wait for the resource to reach the target status. Defaults to `120`. Must be a positive integer.

- **`--project <path>`**

  The path to the Aspire AppHost project file. When specified, the command connects to the AppHost running from that project file without prompting for selection.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Resource reached the target status |
| 7 | No running AppHost found |
| 17 | Timeout exceeded before the resource reached the target status |
| 18 | Resource entered a failed or terminal state while waiting for `up` or `healthy` |

## Examples

- Wait for a resource to be healthy (default):

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait webfrontend
  ```

- Wait for a resource to be running:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait mydb --status up
  ```

- Wait for a resource to stop:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait worker --status down
  ```

- Wait with a custom timeout of 60 seconds:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait webfrontend --timeout 60
  ```

- Target a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire wait mydb --project './src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Use with `aspire run --detach` in a CI/CD pipeline:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire run --detach
  aspire wait webfrontend
  aspire wait mydb --status healthy
  ```
