## Name

## Arguments

The following arguments are available:

- **`integration`**

  The name of the integration to add (for example: redis, postgres).

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`-v, --version`**

  The version of the integration to add.

  The NuGet source to use for the integration.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-wait.md" />

## Examples

- Finds an AppHost project and lists all Aspire integration packages from NuGet:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire add
  ```

- Finds an AppHost project and adds the **kafka** (Aspire.Hosting.Kafka) integration package:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
