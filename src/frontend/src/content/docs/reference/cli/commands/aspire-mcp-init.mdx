## Name

`aspire mcp init` - Initialize MCP server configuration for detected agent environments.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire mcp init [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire mcp init` command detects AI assistant environments (such as VS Code, Visual Studio, Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and others) and configures them to use the Aspire MCP server. This command automates the setup process for integrating Aspire into your AI development workflow.

The command:

1. Detects your Git repository root as the default workspace root
2. Prompts you to confirm or modify the workspace root path
3. Scans for installed AI assistants and development environments
4. Offers to configure each detected environment
5. Optionally creates agent-specific instruction files
6. Configures MCP server settings appropriate for each environment

## Examples

- Initialize MCP configuration with auto-detection:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire mcp init
  ```

  The command will:
  - Detect your Git repository root
  - Scan for AI assistant environments
  - Prompt you to select which environments to configure
  - Set up the MCP server configuration for selected environments

- Run initialization in a specific directory:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
