## Name

`aspire mcp start` - Start the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire mcp start [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire mcp start` command starts the Aspire MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, which enables AI assistants to interact with your Aspire applications. This command is typically used internally by AI assistants when they need to communicate with Aspire.

The MCP server provides tools that allow AI assistants to:

- Query resource information (state, health, endpoints, commands)
- Access console logs from resources
- View structured logs and telemetry
- Examine distributed traces
- Execute resource commands
- Discover available Aspire integrations
- Access integration documentation
- Manage multiple AppHosts

## Options

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

## MCP tools

When the MCP server is running, it exposes the following tools to AI assistants:

### Resource management

- **`list_resources`** - Lists all resources with their state, health status, source, endpoints, and available commands
- **`execute_resource_command`** - Executes a command on a specific resource (e.g., start, stop, restart)

### Logging and telemetry

- **`list_console_logs`** - Lists console logs for a specific resource
- **`list_structured_logs`** - Lists structured logs, optionally filtered by resource name
- **`list_traces`** - Lists distributed traces, with optional resource name filtering
- **`list_trace_structured_logs`** - Lists structured logs associated with a specific trace

### Integration discovery

- **`list_integrations`** - Lists all available Aspire hosting integrations with their package IDs and versions
- **`get_integration_docs`** - Retrieves documentation for a specific Aspire hosting integration package

### AppHost management

- **`list_apphosts`** - Lists all available AppHosts in the workspace
- **`select_apphost`** - Selects a specific AppHost to work with

## Usage

Typically, you don't need to run `aspire mcp start` manually. AI assistants configured with `aspire mcp init` will automatically invoke this command when they need to communicate with Aspire.

However, you can start the MCP server directly if needed:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire mcp start
```

The server will run in the foreground and communicate using the MCP protocol over standard input/output streams.
