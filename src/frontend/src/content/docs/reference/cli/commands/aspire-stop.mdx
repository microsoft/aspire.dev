## Name

`aspire stop` - Stop a running Aspire AppHost.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire stop [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire stop` command stops a running Aspire AppHost process. The CLI scans for running AppHosts and terminates the selected instance along with all its child processes.

When executed without the `--project` option, the command:

1. Scans for all running AppHost processes.
2. If multiple AppHosts are running within the current directory scope, prompts you to select which one to stop.
3. If only one AppHost is running in scope, stops it directly.
4. If no in-scope AppHosts are found but out-of-scope AppHosts exist, displays all running AppHosts for selection.

The command sends a stop signal to the CLI process that started the AppHost, which ensures a clean shutdown of all resources including the dashboard and any containers or processes that were started.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--project <path>`**

  The path to the Aspire AppHost project file. When specified, the command stops only the AppHost running from that project file without prompting for selection.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

## Examples

- Stop the AppHost running in the current directory scope:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop
  ```

- Stop a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop --project './src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj'
  ```
