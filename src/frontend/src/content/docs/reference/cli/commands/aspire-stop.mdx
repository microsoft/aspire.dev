## Name

`aspire stop` - Stop a running Aspire AppHost.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire stop [<resource>] [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire stop` command stops a running Aspire AppHost process, or a specific resource within a running AppHost. When a `<resource>` name is provided, only that resource is stopped. When no resource is specified, the entire AppHost and all its child processes are stopped.

When executed without the `--project` option and without a resource name, the command:

1. Scans for all running AppHost processes.
2. If multiple AppHosts are running within the current directory scope, prompts you to select which one to stop.
3. If only one AppHost is running in scope, stops it directly.
4. If no in-scope AppHosts are found but out-of-scope AppHosts exist, displays all running AppHosts for selection.

The command sends a stop signal to the CLI process that started the AppHost, which ensures a clean shutdown of all resources including the dashboard and any containers or processes that were started.

## Arguments

- **`<resource>`**

  The name of the resource to stop. If not specified, stops the entire AppHost. When a resource name is provided, only that specific resource within the running AppHost is stopped.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--project <path>`**

  The path to the Aspire AppHost project file. When specified, the command stops only the AppHost running from that project file without prompting for selection.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

## Examples

- Stop the AppHost running in the current directory scope:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop
  ```

- Stop a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop --project './src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Stop a specific resource within a running AppHost:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop myresource
  ```
