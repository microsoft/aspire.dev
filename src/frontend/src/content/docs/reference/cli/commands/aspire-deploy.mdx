## Name

`aspire deploy` - Deploy a codebase orchestrated with Aspire to specified targets.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire deploy [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]
```

## Description

The `aspire deploy` command first invokes the [`aspire publish`](../aspire-publish/) command. After which, Aspire invokes all `DeployingCallbackAnnotation` resource annotations, in the order they're declared.

<Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/project-search-logic-description.md" />

The command performs the following steps to deploy an app orchestrated with Aspire:

- Creates or modifies the `.aspire/settings.json` config file in the current directory, and sets the `appHostPath` config value to the path of the AppHost project file.
- Installs or verifies that Aspire's local hosting certificates are installed and trusted.
- Builds the AppHost project and its resources.
- Starts the AppHost and its resources.
- Invokes all `PublishingCallbackAnnotation` resource annotations.
- Invokes all `DeployingCallbackAnnotation` resource annotations.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--`**

  Delimits arguments to `aspire publish` from arguments for the AppHost. All arguments after this delimiter are passed to the apphost.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`-o, --output-path`**

  The output path for deployment artifacts. Defaults to a folder named _deploy_ in the current directory.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-wait.md" />

## Examples

- Search the current directory structure for AppHost projects to build, publish, and deploy:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire deploy
  ```

- Publish and deploy an Aspire apphost and its dependencies:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire deploy --project './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Publish and deploy an Aspire AppHost with arguments:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire deploy --project './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj' -- -fast
  ```
