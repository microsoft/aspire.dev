## Name

`aspire publish` - Generates deployment artifacts for an Aspire AppHost project.

<Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/mode-preview.md" />

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire publish [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]
```

## Description

The `aspire publish` command publishes resources by serializing them to disk. When this command is run, Aspire invokes registered `PublishingCallbackAnnotation` annotations for resources, in the order they're declared. These annotations serialize a resource so that it can be consumed by deployment tools.

<Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/project-search-logic-description.md" />

The command performs the following steps to run an Aspire AppHost:

- Creates or modifies the `.aspire/settings.json` config file in the current directory, and sets the `appHostPath` config value to the path of the AppHost project file.
- Installs or verifies that Aspire's local hosting certificates are installed and trusted.
- Builds the AppHost project and its resources.
- Starts the AppHost and its resources.
- Invokes all `PublishingCallbackAnnotation` annotations for resources.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--`**

  Delimits arguments to `aspire publish` from arguments for the AppHost. All arguments after this delimiter are passed to the AppHost.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-project.md" />

- **`-o, --output-path`**

  The output path for the generated artifacts. Defaults the current directory.

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-help.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-debug.md" />

- <Include relativePath="reference/cli/includes/option-wait.md" />

## Examples

- Search the current directory structure for AppHost projects to build and publish:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire publish
  ```

- Publish a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire publish --project './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Publish a specific AppHost project with arguments:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire publish --project './projects/apphost/orchestration.AppHost.csproj' -- -fast
  ```
