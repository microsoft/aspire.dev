## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire do <step> [options] [[--] <additional arguments>...]
```

## Description

The `aspire do` command executes a specific pipeline step and its dependencies in your Aspire AppHost. This command provides fine-grained control over the orchestration pipeline, allowing you to run individual steps of the deployment or build process.

The command allows you to:

- Execute specific pipeline steps without running the entire pipeline
- Run only the dependencies needed for a particular step
- Test individual pipeline stages during development
- Customize pipeline execution with environment-specific settings

## Arguments

The following arguments are available:

- **`step`**

  The name of the step to execute.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--`**

  Delimits arguments to `aspire do` from arguments for the AppHost. All arguments after this delimiter are passed to the application being run.
