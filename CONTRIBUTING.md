## Environment badge

Set `PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT_BADGE` to display a small text badge beside the header logo
and wordmark, for example `staging`, `test`, or `release/13.6`. The value is public
and rendered as text when Astro builds the site.

Local development (`pnpm dev`, including the frontend started by Aspire) defaults
to `localhost` when the variable is unset. An explicitly empty or whitespace-only
value hides the badge. Production builds have no badge by default; leave the
variable unset or empty for live deployments.

To override the badge locally, set the variable in your shell or in
`src/frontend/.env.local` and restart the dev server:

```dotenv
PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT_BADGE=release/13.6
```

For the Azure DevOps vnext build, set this environment variable on the **frontend
build step**, not only on the deployed host. Use the full release branch name:

```yaml
env:
  PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT_BADGE: $[replace(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/', '')]
```

For `refs/heads/release/13.6`, this renders `release/13.6`. Do not use
`Build.SourceBranchName`, which keeps only the final path segment. Apply this
setting only to the vnext build, not the live build. If vnext builds a different
source branch, set the intended label explicitly instead. Changing the badge on
a deployed static site requires rebuilding its frontend assets.
